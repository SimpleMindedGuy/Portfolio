                            2022-03-March-17-Thursday

I'ts been a long time since I last wrote my diary, lots of things happened
I decided that I'm not going to write until I'm done with my project, and today I was finally done, I think I tested everything, and everything have worked so far.

I finally have what I wanted to have 2 years ago, A website where I write and update my projects, my diary, and what I've been up to in general.

It's done now, but I'm not going to stop working on it, But I'm going to leave it for a few months, and focus on learning something new.

What have I been up to
I'm still struggling a bit with spending my time with on my own, but It's getting easier and easier over time, but now I think I have a Different problem.

Too much work ?
So now that I can't really waste my time talking with other people, Now I spend almost all of my time just working on my project.

And I noticed that it's just work that I do, and now I'm having a hard time doing anything else, as soon as I start playing a game or watch something I start thinking, "I should be working right now, I'm wasting time, I need to build skills".

It seems like I'm just doing too much of one thing, and Probably making a schedule would be better for me in the future.

OverThinker
I got a bit confused with how I'm going about my relationship with people, I'm starting to lean more and more towards just totally forgetting about the groups that I use to spend my time with.

And maybe go find another, or not find any group at all, and spend the whole of my time or at least most of it by my self.

Sometimes it seems like my friends don't really like me, and I'm not sure if that's just me overthinking stuff or not, sometimes it seems to me like my friends usually tend to avoid me more than not.

It could be just me in the end, I do have a history of over thinking things after All

Fuck windows
So Uni started, and I only have to go there 2 days a week only, and that's good and all, but 2 of my courses want me to use C# and Microsoft Visual Studio (not Visual Studio Code).

And this means I have to switch from Linux to windows, and this might not seem like a problem, but it turned out to be a bit annoying.

It toke me 2 days, because I had to change my Hard Drive's File system, Which means I had to back up all my data, thankfully I had an external Hard Drive, and that toke almost all day to copy.

Then I had to install windows, which I hated, I don't have my shortcuts , I don't have my virtual desktops, I can't customize my desktop look.

And to be honest, I don't really know what people like about windows anymore, cuz It does things really slowly compared to linux.

Other than some games and some software, I don't know why people like windows too much, All We need is to make linux More user friendly (it already is), and I think the move would be much easier.

Things are looking good
Now that I'm done with the project, I made a video about it today, and I just need to edit it and uploaded.

And I'm going to be using it to update my portfolio on github, it's going to make things way easier to do now than what it used to be.

I'm planing to learn a few things in the next few months, and see if I'm going to stick to one of them or just I'm going to keep working with multiple things at once.

I have some high hopes for the next few months, things will get better.                        </p>

I spent almost all day working or trying to work, and I've made some progress, I'm going to update my website tomorrow, and see where that goes.

And thing is very close to be done, few more days, and I'll have it as finish with almost all the functionalities I want to have.

I got few messages from my friends, after I left the communities, And they were wondering why I left, and I told them that I'm fine (not really), and one of them told me I'm welcome to come back whenever I want.

I thanked them, and that was it, and I kept on working, I've been a bit anxious about me leaving the groups I left, and probably the people I left behind.

Not sure if they well not accept me again, but I have to try to work on my self, and look after my self more for now, maybe I'm being selfish.

I'm already doing more work, and it seems like it's a step in the right direction, I'll keep on doing this and see how it goes.

I talked to a friend, and tried to talk as much as I can about what's bothering me, we talked about it for a while, and they told me maybe I'm being too dependent on people listening to me. And they might be right.

We kept talking for a few hours, and I think I'll just try to keep to my self more, hope that things well keep on improving.

I'm not exactly doing the best, but I'm not doing very bad.                        </p>

                    <h3>Pain</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2022-02-February-26-Saturday

Been uneventful today, I tried to work, and managed to do something, still not as much as I would like to do, but as keep saying some progress is better than no progress.

Starting to leave
So I think I'll keep on slowly getting out of the communities that I'm currently in, I'm probably gonna stay in one or two but not any more than that.

I'm also planing to only keep communicating with important friends, and maybe not do too much of that too, hopefully this would free up more time.

Lurking
I'm still thinking that some of my friends are avoiding me now, I'm not exactly sure about it, but I'll try to delay my judgment on that, I'm still also not sure why, and to me, they don't seem to want me around.

Now, I totally can write this as me being the hero, but I probably did something without noticing it, and I really want to keep things as is, so I'm gonna try my best to wire what actually happened

Weird one
Weird thing is yesterday I tried to join one of my friends, and they refused, but because of how buggy the game was, I decided to ask if I had a bad timing or if they didn't receive my request.

They said I had bad timing, but I could still text them, and fair enough, decided not to keep bothering them, but then they sort of started asking me about feeling, which is normal actually.

They usually ask me questions about my mental, and I do answer those as accurate as I can, and sometimes that's just how we talk.

Emotional ?
And it felt like I'm ... being interrogated or something, again this could be my judgment being cloudy, but that's how it seemed to me at the time.

Also found it a bit weird, when it's not a good timing for me to be there (I was trying to join them in vrchat), but still kept talking to me.

All this is kinda enforcing that ... maybe my friends are trying to avoid me, and I'm not about to go around and say it's not my fault, it actually could be, but I really don't know.

Shaky judgment
At the time I'm writing this, I'm not sure if I should try again to be honest, cuz then I might end up making the thing worse, it's not like I hate them, but I'm emotional currently, and I could do something stupid.

And been thinking maybe this is the best choice I have, so I'll keep on doing it, and see where this goes, I still can keep my most important communications going, still I'll be a bit sad if I lose more friends.

Resisting
I've been kinda lurking everywhere, not sure if I should cancel the plan and just act like nothing happened, and go talk to my friends, but I kept on fighting this desire all day.

As much as I enjoy the company, it could be one of the reasons things are not going as well as I wish they are, maybe I could be using it as an excuse for not doing things.

Or it could be just bad for me all together, So I'll keep on fighting though this pain, and hope that it does not totally break me, I can say that it's not a fun process at all.

Mental
I'm still kinda depressed, and I feel a bit exhausted from the past few days, I'm starting to get some headaches too, not sure what's that about, and I'm having a lot of mixed thoughts.

Are the friends I made so far really are my friends ?
Do I keep on just leaving everyone on the hopes that I don't get attached to anyone again ?
Is it even the right thing to do ? Or is this going to end up with me going mad ?
Who are my important friends? How do I know them ?
Will I ever find a group I belong to? Am I already there and don't realize it yet?
Am I just trapped in this process of finding and leaving people? Convincing my self, every time, that this is where I stay?
Is my work just for nothing, and am I just doomed to fail?
Those questions are raising a massive amount of anxiety, and a little bit of anger and pain, Hope that going through this would help me be someone better.

This and also feeling undesirable, it not a really fun place to be at, and ... I don't think I can even get to complain, I thought I won't be dealing with this feeling again, but here I am.

Never again, I'll be getting close to people or allowing them to get close to me, maybe it is just how life is, and so be it, I'll stick to my games, work, and tools, see how long this can last before I can't continue anymore.

I'll keep on going, but still, it's very painful.                        </p>

Did not do much today, I made pizza dough preparing for the next week or maybe few days, and this toke me quite a lot of time, I'm not good at it XD, but usually the end result is good.

I tried to work, but also got distracted a lot, tried to play games at first, didn't work well, so I tried to get to work, got few things fixed, and worked on the design too.

Not as much work as I would like to do, but some work, some progress is better than no progress, I'll be trying to do more and hope that it goes well.

Doubts
Today I've been heavy on the emotional side of things, been thinking about the few things that happened this week :

I made one of my friends angry for discussing something, and noticed that every discussion we had led to them getting more and more frustrated towards me.
I made another friend upset with me, because it seemed for them like I was talking all by my self, while for me it seemed like I was just trying to explain in detail, both of those could be true at the same time, but at least they told me, and I know that maybe I should limit the amount of time I take to talk about something.
I'm also being a bit annoyed at how I'm being treated in some places, and decided to leave those places, it got a bit ridiculous, so I decided it's probably time to leave, and to be honest I'm not planing to come back.
I'm also not sure if my friends really want me to be around, I know some of them do, but it's starting to look like people starting to get upset with me, which is fair enough, cuz there is a higher chance that I'm the crazy one there.
Those things are starting to make me doubt if I can solve the problems assuming they are my fault, while at the same time being a bit confused to where I made a mistake in some of them.

And it's making me think if I want to keep on maintaining as many things as I have right now, for me, it seems a lot, and most of those problems are social ones, and I don't want to just run away from the problem.

I'm starting to think that it's time to actually lower the social connections I have, and focus more on what to work on, like projects, and only the important relationships that I have.

Limiting my time even more when it comes to spending it with people, and maybe stop trying to make new friends, so can focus enough on the work I do, while keeping my connections maintained.

This might end up hurting some of the people that I know now, but going to ... forget about and move on, but I think I have to choose this, because I have to look after my self too.

I'm sorry, but if I want to fix my life, I need to do this

Emotional
These things are giving me a mix of emotions, I think it's getting me again, and I may not be thinking straight, so may not be the best decision.

Depressed and upset
So, some of my friends are upset with me, and I can't exactly find out why, I'm gaining even more weight, my sleep schedule is not how I want it to be.

I'm not being as productive as I want, I'm not building good habits, My bad habits are taking over, things are not shaping up very well.

Those things are just messing with me, because I'm trying to find out about my fuckups, while at the same time keeping with my projects, and it's kinda draining.

It could be that I'm doing too much at once, and lowering the load of one part, well ease doing the other parts, and that could be what I need to do.

It's not that I want to leave because I'm depressed and I need a break and the world is evil, but it's because I'm starting to think I'm trying to pick up a heavier load than I can actually carry.

So I'm gonna hope that I did the right thing and go with it, it's really hard to know those things for sure, it's almost impossible so, I'll try to focus on the progress, and hope for the best.

Hope that it goes well.                        </p>

Today have been, quick, kinda didn't do much at all, but I managed to fix some of my projects bugs, but didn't really work as long as I would have liked.

Actually made food, was a bit frustrated in the process, didn't turn out the way I wanted it to be, but was fine in the end.

After that, I played some video games, and it was a bit "tasteless" at some point, but still didn't start working as soon as that happened.

Eventually got to work and, was a bit weird, learned something new, fixed some mistakes, thing works as intended, thought would do more work today, still I'm really close to finish, maybe in few days.

Was really bored most of the time, been trying to avoid communicating with people, but didn't exactly manage to actually do that.

Still showed up for few hours, but still way less than what I usually do, so maybe I can limit that time in there, or maybe eliminate it.

Not sure still if that is the right move, I don't think I'll know until later on.

Let's hope that I end up making the right decision.                        </p>

Today I tried to spend all my time working on the project again, got most of the design part done, got to the back-end, everything started to crash at the group permissions, for some reason it crashes when I try to add permissions to multiple groups.

Been thinking a lot about abandoning my friendships today, seems like things when south the past few days, I'm not sure if I'm the one who ruins the relationships I have, but it seems like I'm doing something wrong.

Seems like I'm making a lot of mistakes, around my friends, and it seems to affect the relationship, and it's not like I don't want to work on it, but it's very tiring.

Trying to correct those mistakes is a bit difficult, seems like I did upset a few of my fiends, I'm not sure if they want to talk to me again, any time soon at least.

So the thought of distancing people starting to seem like a viable idea, although I could end paying a higher price than I would like to pay for, but I won't know until it's too late.

As a start, I decide to limit my time on discord(communication app), and sort of distance my self from the groups that I'm usually active at, The plan so far is just to slowly lower activity until I'm no longer active in any of those groups.

I'm probably going to end up also ending my relationship with a lot of people doing that, probably some of them are going to be very valuable friends.

However, I'm not totally sure if that is a good solution, it could end up damaging me in the end, it has few ups and downs

ups :

I can be more productive.
A more stable schedule.
Can maintain better mood for much longer.
Learning new skills.
downs :

Much easier for me to get addicted short term easy
I get really lonely every now and then
Not gonna have anyone to talk to when I need it
Society around maybe be a bit of abuse towards me
And I could be just sacrificing too much doing that, I still have great friends, that I might end up leaving or loosing.

I'm not sure what I need to do, but for now I'm planing to limit the time I spend with people, or I could just seek to talk to some of them.

hope i made the right move.                        </p>

I worked for a bit on the project today, almost got it finished, but ended up dealing with a few problems, so, and I stopped at that.

Wanted to work more, but then switched to something else, decided to make pizza dough enough for 3 pizzas, found out that we don't have enough yeast, so I canceled that.

Canceled that, switch to making an orange cake, decided to use a blinder for mixing some stuff, couldn't find it where it usually is, spent about 20 min looking for almost in everywhere in my house, except of course where it was.

And it built a lot of anger, but eventually I made the cake, it was fine, and I started to feel less angry.

One of my friends today got really mad at me, It was because of me saying something that they didn't like, they did sound like they got angry, and they left the voice call shortly after.

I think, I should probably not argue with them about anything really, they seem to have a side that can't exactly take the opposite idea.

I spent a lot of time talking to new friends in VRC, we spent a lot of time together again, I stayed up because I was ... angry.

Felt like being around people I like would help with it, maybe talking about what happened, or just about anything to ease things a bit.

We eventually talked about personal opinion about few things, and I noticed at some point my friend stopped replaying to what I say, and I think I probably talked for too long about one thing.

And I don't think they liked it, They told me what they thought about what exactly happened, they also told me that I seem to be just talking in my own bubble.

Which is possible, I'm not immune to error, they told me that they feel like I would not exactly listen to them, or was not listening to them.

Even tho, in my prospective, I was just saying my point of view to that subject, still I could have probably talked for too long.

And I also thought they would intervene, and tell me their point, but they said that they would not do that.

Maybe I am living in my own bubble, maybe it's miss-communication, maybe it's just me talking too much, and there is also the thing where I think too fast, and I need to say something before I just move somewhere else.

And yeah, I could work on my part, and I'll try my best to listen or at least pause every now and then to give people the chance to talk.

I'm gonna try not to be a piece of shit when I'm talking about my points or opinions, after all we don't agree on a lot of things really, and I think that I don't give them enough space to talk.

Gonna try to be better at this.                        </p>

Didn't sleep yesterday I ended up staying awake for too long, I stay up until 7am today, and I slept until 11-12, so about 4 hours of sleep, the reason was because I want to fix my sleep today.

And hopefully I'll wake up at 6am next day, I was too tired throughout the whole day to do anything, so not much stuff happened, most of what happened was around 1am—5am

I spent a lot of time with my 2 friends, we talked a bit, I think I may have overshared about my self, maybe not, but I still enjoyed the time, was trying to stay up for as long as possible, and they helped me do that.

Was nice to get to know each other so, been all of us talking, but mostly I did most of the talking to be honest, and I'm not sure if it is a good thing but, they didn't exactly seem to mind that too, still not sure if that's a good thing or not.

I'm planing to finish my project before the end of this week, there is a real chance this time to actually finish it, and I'm a bit excited.

Hope that I'll be able to pull this off this time.

Things are gonna get better, I hope.                        </p>

Been trying to keep my focus more on work today, I want to be more productive, and the thing is, I just can't ignore that, I'm way more efficient when I'm not around people and talking to them.

Progress so far
I still couldn't finish the project to day, but I'm thinking I'm definitely going to always work outside the voice chats more, so that I can be more productive.

Thoughts for the future
However, I'm really close maybe I'll finish it before the end of this week for real now, and it's existing, after that all I'm going to do is learn new things, and make my project work faster, and more efficiently.

I probably gonna also start learning calculus and algebra again soon, So I'm going to focus on it a bit more this year.

Few Positive things.
The new friend I talked about yesterday actually listened to my podcast, and they seem to like it, at least that's what they said to me, I guess again, I have to try to trust that till I see something that suggest that they lied or something, however I have hopes that they are not lying.

So far so good
They seem to be relaxed too, so I don't think they exactly dislike me, which Is good I would say, usually I think people try to avoid me most the time.

Which is a bit understandable, cuz I could end up just sticking to people, or sticking to a specific topic.

Doubt
Things that been on my mind recently is, that people -younger or older than me- who are in the same field know way more than I do, and I feel like the things that I work on, would just be ... uninteresting to talk about for them.

Falling behind
And this does actually affect me, of course, gives me the sense that I'm not exactly smart enough to be around those people and talk to them about this field.

I end up questioning my ability to do things and be actually useful in a work environment, making me think that I should leave the field for good.

Pessimism
But it's probably just ... life, again I'm still young and learning, still I really think I'm way far behind, and it does make things hard to keep going sometimes.

However, I know for sure this is not the end for me, this is again just life, there well always be people who well do way better than I'm doing, it is what it is, and that's fine by me.

I guess mostly the thing that bothering me is how dependent and slow I am compared to everyone I know so, there is the sense that I'm at the bottom of it all, and that might be true.

Mostly negative
It's probably the sense that I'm at the bottom and there is no way for me to compete with the others that fucks with my mind, it's like isolated people, who have no friends to play with, really it's a miserable place to be at, I know exactly how bad it is.

And it could be the case that I'm not, but I guess when I'm a pessimist, things just tend to be more on the "bad side" of things from my view.

Feeling stuck
Maybe whatever I crave or desire to have now, is not exactly a good thing to have at the moment, or maybe it is, but I still probably have to go through more things to get there.

It's mostly my prospective of my life being just a constant failure, not much success, sometimes it feels like no success at all, but also the being almost totally dependent, and this make it seem like things are just going to be like this, because it's always been like this.

Change
But things do change all the time, and I'm pretty sure I'll figure something out, I might be underestimating my self, and it's probably me who is putting my self down.

I'm going to try to be better at things and hopefully it well workout.                        </p>

Been working today, spent about 4-5 hours working on the project trying to get a feature done, things still went relatively slowly, but got it semi working in the end.

But wasn't really all perfect, cuz I ended up trying to get a feature working, at the end I decided that it's better to implement that feature in different way.

And that was ... the end of about 3 hours of work that ended up being for nothing.

I might change my mind about this tomorrow, and just keep it as is, so guess I need to do more planning before I get to work.

I also finished editing the podcast finally, uploaded it to youtube here, I'm actually happy about it, I sent it to some friends that I think are interested in it.

I spent sometime talking to a new possible friend, I met them in VR-chat, they seem really nice, a bit introverted, which is a very common thing in VR-chat, I think they are interesting to talk to.

I ended up sharing my podcast with them, and I think it's a bit “sneaky” from me to do, I'm not sure if it's a good thing to do.

Maybe they could be a good friend, who knows, it's nice to meet new people, it's always interesting to talk to people, I'm starting to find almost everyone interesting.

But at the same time, I'm still leaning towards being an introvert tho so, I might not meet them a lot.

I think things are going to be good in the near future, I'm gonna try to focus more on my work.                        </p>

I didn't get much done yet, I still haven't decided how I'm going to get some functions working, but things are fine, mostly, my sleep is still messed up, and I'm still being lazy.

I need to try to get back and do my prayers, that's probably the most important, I wasn't very productive today too, maybe I can also work on that, I'm also writing this in a hurry a bit, so things are all over the place.

I'll have to finish my project before the end of next week, if possible, I'm very close, I know what I want to do with 90% of it, it's just the last 10% that I'm not sure about, but hopefully it would be fine.                        </p>

                             2022-02-February-17-Thursday

Today, I was planning to work on the project, get done with the permission system, but I was really lazy, and decided that I'm not going to do that, just spent sometime playing games.

Rusty boys
Was able to get a hold of my podcast buddy, and I decided that we're going to do a podcast today, and I think it went well.

We go with the flow
We just started talking like normal, kinda winging it, and I think it went fine, At the begging it was pretty slow, and it seemed like it's not heading anywhere.

Topic : Sins and humility
But, it was actually fine, and talked about humility in religions, and that the job of humility is to remind us about our imperfection, that we are in fact sinful.

The good person delusion
And we seem to forget about our mistakes so easily, because we don't want to see ourselves as bad people, and to protect ourselves we make excuses.

But, this end up making us worse people in the end, ignoring our mistakes, thinking that we are better than everyone else, because we're blinded from our's.

The humility solution
Humility helps solving that problem, because we admit to ourselves of our own sins/mistakes, while also admitting it to god, and we ask for forgiveness.

When we admit those sins to our selves, we also see our selves as we actually are, imperfect, and sinful, focusing our attention on our actions and hopefully fixing our behavior.

The aftermath
I enjoyed the podcast a lot to be honest, we are planing to do another one soon too, if we get to, I really hope we do.

A problem
When I was done with the recording I decided to edit the video, and maybe publish it at the same day, but unfortunately didn't finish editing the video yet.

And I found a problem as I was watching it my self, and for some reason my microphone was making a weird humming sound, through the whole recording.

And that's going to make editing the video a nightmare at some point, but it is what it is, and I'll try to finish it tomorrow, and also add it to the journal.

Something new
I also decided to meet one of my friends in vrchat tonight, and I ended meaning new person, they seem fine, and maybe a new friend, they seem “chill”, maybe I'll be making a new friend soon.

Trying to do better
I want to do more things to be honest, I should try to fix my sleep, and I should try to be more productive, if possible, and finish the project as soon as I can.

I'll try to do that in the next few days.

Things gonna be getting better, I hope.                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Trying to learn something new
Today I was trying to work on a software called "pipewire", and it's supposed to be a sound server system, that can handle everything that is making sounds in the operating system.

It does that, I think it does it pretty well to be honest, the problem was with the customization part of it.

The good part
Pipewire is an open source software, which is good, it opens makes it so that other people who are experienced in coding, able to change and customize the software.

And that was what I was trying to do, the problem is pipewire is still in “early” stages of development, and even tho it does its job well, It's still missing a few things here and there, but I can for the most part work without it.

The annoying part
After a few hours of reading, or at least trying to read and understand the documentation of that software, I was even more confused about how to customize it.

Fuck pipewire
The documentation is not good its allover the place, and it does not have good examples, it does not have a table of all the commands and what they do.

It does not really explain everything which is bad, and that is making me think of my project and writing good documentations for it.

Lesson learned
It shows that, even if you made a really good software made and made it free, if you don't document it very well, it's almost useless.

I'll try to look for what other people might have done to do what I'm trying to do with my setup.

The potential
If I somehow manage to do it right, I might end up with perfect configurations, that anyone can use for video/audio production purposes, or just a better control over the sound in a Linux system, which might at least help people migrating.

Mental health
I've been kinda weird the past few weeks, and I'm swinging between feeling lonely and angry, I still miss my friends and I feel bad for their situations.

I'm being more of a “feeling” kind of person than I would like to be, it seems to affect my productivity, to be honest, I'm not sure how I'm going to handle it.

But I'm trying to keep on working I'm going to try to keep on moving, getting things done, learning new things.

And I do get to good points every now and then, I guess that's just how it is, probably that's just life, and I'm not realizing it.

Ignored, or just paranoid.
Been trying to communicate with a friend recently, and ... it seems like they are ignoring me, I know that they might be going through some tough time.

Situations like those get me a bit paranoid I guess, However, and to be fair to my friends, I also struggle with keeping up with people, and replying to them.

I'm not perfect in my self, and It's not like I'm the first priority in anyone's life, things are more complicated of course.

I guess writing this is not to show that I “know things”, it's more like me checking my sanity.

Things to work on
So I'm planning to keep working on the permission system, it's getting close, I need to make it so that the permissions can be edited, and make a new user group.

Make sure that promoting groups won't brake the permissions priorities, and I need to make sure that permissions can't be given on one level, then moved to a higher level than the “promoter” can assign that permission for.                        </p>

                    <h3>Procrastination, Anger, frustration, and loneliness</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2022-02-February-15-Tuesday

I've been sort of avoiding doing this diary for a few weeks, I guess just procrastinating, every day I would say I'll do it the next night, and in the next night I would be too lazy.

Loneliness
I'm still feeling sort of lonely, it's probably a mix of missing my friends, not having anyone to talk about what bothering me, and also a bit hesitant to ask for help.

I'm sort of hopeless to where I would seek help from, I can't really talk to my parents, my friends already have a lot to deal with.

Frustration
Been sort of trying to work on the website for a while now, and most of what I've done, if not all, was on the front end, which is the part I work on when I don't feel like I can handle some complicated things.

And I probably did 3-6 on the “complicated” side of things, things felt slow, and I want to do more work, things need to be done eventually.

It is making me a bit frustrated, not getting work done, I'll keep on trying to keep on working on every day, and see where that takes me, I believe the things well be done soon tho.

Anger
A few days ago, I sort of ended up … let's say indirectly hurting someone, and I also learned about my friend's “health” situation.

Not being able to help really, I get angry about my self, causing problems and being useless almost in every situation.

To me, sometimes It seems like I'm just running things around me, and I just don't fix it.

Updates soon
I'm planing to do few things in the next few days, I want to update the website, try to apply for intern jobs, and actually finish the project, then optimizing it, as much as possible.                        </p>

                            2022-01-January-30-Sunday

I kinda wanted to “study” a little, but that didn't really happen, the subject is just easy for me that I really don't think I need to study for, guess I'm gonna find out tomorrow.

Some Rust on my gears
I've been trying to work on my project today, and still really hard to get things done for some reason, still kinda getting distracted by things, couldn't really can work very well.

I still didn't really do my chores, and any of my prayers, it's kinda still hard to focus and do things, it's kinda tricky, but I'll be able to do it soon, more awareness is what I need.

A bit of loneliness
I've spent quite a lot of time around people recently, but I still feel a bit of loneliness for some reason, I'm not sure what caused it.

It could be because I'm not doing much with my time, just sitting and trying to talk to people, when I should be working on something, or cleaning my room, or doing my prayer.

Maybe I am feeling lonely, even tho I spent time with people I like, we talked quite a bit and I actually enjoyed my time around them, but it still is there.

Who knows, I'm gonna try to distract my self from being lonely by trying to work on stuff.

Updating soon.
So my I asked my friend If they don't mind if I share that argument we had few days ago, and they said that they don't mind it.

I'll be trying to write it down bt the end of this week, and also update my diary on my website, they said they don't mind reading it to make sure its private enough.

I just want to make sure that keep people in my diary as private as possible, cuz I don't want to end up sharing things that are to obvious about people, or their name, or even their gender.

But I'm kinda excited to update my diary, I'm a bit upset about feeling lonely, and a bit nervous cuz its my finals.

but things are going to be ok.                        </p>

                             2022-01-January-29-Saturday

So I've been meaning to do my journal for about 5 days now, and I just didn't do it, mostly because I was tired as hell at the end of the day and just forgot about it by the time I was going to sleep.

Forcing some change
So the past few days I decided that, it's time to go through some change, and I think this time a lot of things gonna have to change, probably going to change the way I act, talk, how I spend my day, and how I'm doing things.

It's going to be tough, of course, but I'm thinking that the end result is worth it, I think.

A bit shaky
I haven't been doing any of my prayers recently, it's kinda hard for me to just remember to do it, I think I need a better way for tracking of my time, and remind my self about those tasks.

They are not annoying me, they are not hard, and they don't take a lot of time to do, So I think just need a reminder, or just to be more aware about how I spend my day.

Progress
Been also working on the project past few days, got few things updated, but It's not fully done yet, however the last problem is about to be solved.

I almost did all the implementation, but now I need to test the function normally, then eventually have to try to write some testing for the project.

I'm going to be done with in the next week for sure, but the unit testing have to wait till later.

Uni related
I was studying almost all day last Tuesday, I was getting ready for a linear algebra on the day after, then I read some news on the uni website, and found out that the exam got delayed.

So now I kinda have more time to get really, although I was a bit annoyed about the fact that it got delayed, but it is what it is.

Snow storm
So the reason that the exam got delayed is because of a snow storm that was expected to hit that day, and just in case, the government decided that it's better to shut down schools and universities for that day.

And it turned out that they were right about the weather, that night we had a snow storm in my area, which didn't happen in a few years, I went outside, I spent about 2 hours in the snow storm, and I try to take footage of the storm.

It wasn't a terrible storm I was able to move normally and such, but I got to see the area cover in snow, and it looked very beautiful.

I walked a bit in the town and continued to take footage, I'm going to try to use them as animated wallpaper.

When I got back I was freezing, I was not soaked in water, but I thought that I'll get sick from the cold, but I didn't, next day I was fine.

Good Friendships
It seems that I have made some good friendships in the online world, yesterday, I spent some time with my online friends in vr-chat, I wasn't very talkative I was mostly just around people, I talked a bit.

And seems that people do like, some of them been really nice to me that day, I'm not sure why but some of them seemed nicer than I usually remember, which I really appreciate.

I ended up messaging them about it, told them that I enjoyed their company, and that I do appreciate them, they replied that they do actually like me, and I think I can believe that, at least until I see things that suggest they are lying, but I don't think they are.

Another one of my friends seem to have a bit of tough time, I was checking on them every now and then, make sure they are doing ok, they said they'll be fine, but I still made sure they know, I don't mind helping any way I can, if think they need anything.

My friend told me it's weird that I'm being wholesome, because we usually just act terribly around each other, it's mostly us just joking with each other, it's not that we hate each other.

I told them that I can be nice to people, and that I do care about them, and I'll try to be there for the people I care for when I think they need me.

Improvement
Things are getting better, slowly, but THEY ARE improving, and that alone is good, maybe it's not all doomed, and may be the better I am, the better my life is going to be over all.

it's going to be ok.                        </p>

                    <h3>Distracted.</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2022-01-January-24-Monday

Today I was supposed to be studying, but unfortunately I got my self distracted, it's not good at all, it's been weird trying to do things, but I do lack discipline, hope thing are better tomorrow, not much really happened to today tho.

Communicating
I ended up talking to a friend, about things that we kinda don't agree on totally, been something about religion and weird social issues, and my thoughts on those topics.

Me being Weird again
And some of those issues do concern and include that friend, and it told them, that regardless of my disagreement, I do really like them, actually, I think they are one of the best friends on the online world.

We talked about it for a bit, I would write about, but currently I'm tired, and it's really late, I'm going to try to write that tomorrow, or the day after.

The Conversation
I'm writing this at 2022-02-February-06-Sunday about 2 weeks after we had this conversation, I Wanted to write earlier, but I was just lazy, I'm gonna try my best to be as accurate as I can.

Back story
So the whole thing started, when I decide to message my friend about how I could not get a hold of another friend that I do the podcast with, and was starting to think that I won’t be making anymore for a while.

They said that I still could try to pull some other people and do it with them, but I also thought that I won't be able to find anyone that I can talk to for hours, without them being bored with my ass.

Shared struggle
I asked them about a project they're working on, A story they are writing, I'm kinda excited to read more about it, but I also told them that I was hesitant to ask them before, Since I knew they are already dealing with some Pressure.

They told me that they appreciated my concern, and they did have some problems to deal with that made working on the project difficult, if not impossible.

And I do understand that, I have my struggles too, they said that sometimes they do X amount of work, and they think it's not enough, and I think that makes them feel overwhelmed with the task.

Which, does remind me, of my self working on my project, and trying to fix my life, dealing with weird mental health issues.

But told them that any progress, even 10% progress, is much better than no progress at all, and it doesn't matter how much it would take them to get it done, they well get there eventually.

A lot in Common
I said that we're all a miss really, we are not so different really, and I don't mean that as me and my friend, but I mean us as humans.

We both had some issues that we're dealing with, productivity is one we had in common, we both are trying to pick our projects, getting our lives together.

We also seem to share the idea that, being social online with people, did serve is good, but also seem to have a bad effect too.

Something that feels overwhelming, a problem that seem unsolvable, goals that seem unachievable.

Looking at the bright side of things
But in the spirit of me trying to change to the best, I tried to be more pessimistic about things, saying all that "things still can improve, if we just work on ourselves" thing.

Hoping to cheer them up a bit, and maybe remind them that there is some bright side to things, things actually can improve, I do believe that.

We have somewhat similar and also very different views on the society, philosophy, and religion.

I remember saying something like
" Unfortunately, us humans, can't just buy and new one, when something in us goes wrong in us ".

The topic
And at some point, and for some reason, I decided to share some of my views on things, how I look at my self, how I look at other things around me, and other people.

But also told them that I'm not sure if what I'm going to say would hurt them at the time.

They told me to just say, and we could see where that can take us from there.

My argument #1
And I basically share my thoughts on multiple things at once.

That I do definitely think there is a lot of “wrong” with things like :

The whole gay, trans, and weird sexualities that normal people don't understand, are taking all over the west.

The bullring of world's meanings, and how it seems like people are being too weak to stand-up for themselves sometimes or just take a joke.

And how that a lot of that community is acting in a vengeful way towards everyone that does not believe in their ideas.

I do also think that a lot for wrong can, and does come from "religion", or at least the people who practice it

We saw isis, and taliban, they claim they are the good ones even tho they're terrorizing people lining near their "domains", and they kill civilians from different countries, saying that it's just, in the name of islam or god.

But regardless of me disagreeing on things with my friends, and me thinking that they have “wrong ideas”, I definitely don't think they should be “punished” for it.

And I do think that there is A lot that is wrong with me too, I do deal with anger issues, sometimes depression, too stubborn, and the thought that I do deserve more than I have.
Sometimes I want to torture on everyone that ever wronged me.

And I don't think that acceptance is always a good thing, I don't think I should support people in doing things that I believe are wrong, or going to harm them in the end.

But my guess is that respect is the best thing we can do, and respecting each other would at least allow us to actually understand that we all are human.
And, even tho we disagree on a lot of things, any of us could be in the exact same position as the "other", that we might think of as our enemy.

My friend's Argument #1
My friend did understand why I was hesitant to say what I said, and they seem to understand my views on those issues, the whole LGBT community is acting very hostile towards the "other".

They also told me that they, don't really like religions, and for them, it seems manipulative, and controlling.

And they think that of the whole "weird sexualities" situation, is also partly that people don't really know how to deal with it.

And they there is scientific proves that these people can't just simply change.

There is a very rare situation were someone would be born with a male genitalia or body, but also would have a female brain, or the other way around.

They said that there is evidence for that situation to happen, which is extremely rare, but still exists,

And for normal people, they just don't get how things are going in that person's brain, and they can't help it, and that person would just seem crazy to other normal people.

And because of how politics in the west became so ingrained in everything, that person would be considered to have a specific politic leaning, which could make their life easier or harder, depending on where they live.

Because of how one party is usually connected to religion, they end up ignoring all the evidence about that kind of situation, and reject people who deal with this problem, or defend the people who deal with it.

For my friend, people in this situation suffer a lot as a result of things being out of their hand, and I do believe that.

And they end up in the situation where, they are being harmed because of religion.

They told me they won't hate me for my belief in my religion, and they wont hold it against me, as long I don't it against them.

My argument #2
I told my friend that I understand there is a possibility of someone being born with a female body and a male brain.

Once there is a bit of complications, anything can happen.

And I do think that the society for sure don't exactly know how to deal with it, it's so rare that it almost doesn't exist.

And I told them that, the problem now is, there is usually a big link between those cases, and mental illness, people being abused by one parent, families in the west being fragmented, and porn addiction(and I'm guilty of that one).

Also, that people are becoming so dependent on a force to destroy the opposing ideas, and those forces like governments or big co-operations, can end up with a lot of power, that they will decide everything eventually.

And once they are not being supported anymore, they won’t be able to survive, because of how dependent they were.

People won't be able to decide anything for themselves, and well eventually agree to anything that the government suggests in order to "protect" them from the "other"

There is also the problem of Pedophiles(people who want to engage with sexual activities with children), we can also argue that things are out of their hands too.

Do we just let them abuse children, or what do we do with them ?, the issue is if one would suggest therapy for this case, then why not suggest that for all the other cases?

I told them that in my opinion that both of our arguments do have very important points.

And that I try as much as I can to look at it as a human, and not just take my side as being absolutely right, and the other being just wrong, and I keep in mind that I'm talking to another human, and what ever they experience, can happen to anyone else, including me.

I understand why they don't like religions that much, and I do agree that it can lead to a situation where one group could end up being controlling over other groups.

Or a group being controlling over its members, but the limitations within the religions are not for nothing, they exist for a reason.

Religion is like playing a game, you can do a lot of things with in a game, but you still have to stay with in the game's rules.

Not anyone can just join the game, they need to know the rules, they need to know the people too.

as to not be too open, and not to be too closed.

There is a lot of flexibility in religions, and I just don't think we do understand them 100%, and its not easy to just come up with a decision to how to deal with other groups, other than just leaving them the hell alone, as long as they are not harming anyone.

And really technically most religions would say, they just argue with the people, don't hate them, maybe they would change, maybe they won't, you're not to control people.

I also told them that I don't think that we can replace religions really. ,but that could be just my view.

I told my friend that I don't hate them for what they believe, I do actually like them, despite our disagreements, they still respect me, and I respect them.

And my argument is not to attack them, and probably arguing with each other would help us understand each other and be a bit close to each other, more than the other way around

My friend's argument #2
They said they think that religions can be replaced with new ideologies, but they mostly think that because they are not religions -which is fair-.

They still have core values that they believe in, and that there are new values and systems of thoughts that can replace religion, and that people can live without religions.

Things like communism (ignoring the shit show it resulted in for a second), is a value system that people lived with.

They agree that the core values from most religions are good.

They seem to have an issue with the whole thing, where some people say "well you're an atheist, but you're a good person still because you live in a religious country were raised with religious values", but those values exist in all the other religions, and also some philosophies.

They said that the structure and order of society, does not need based on religion, and in recent history religion was mostly the only option, and in their opinion it does not need to be this way anymore.

But they also said forcing a change, would not be a good move, and the best way to go about it is to do it slowly through new generations.

And that the problem in the west is that people want change to happen immediately, and that can't just happen; because people can just change so quickly, and that would just make the situation worse.

As for the pedophile problem, most people agree that it's an ok thing to do, and most of them despise child predators, and that children need to be left alone because they are not fully developed.

The Pedophile argument annoys them a lot, because everyone that argues against most of the LGBT ideas, bring that issue up, and the LGBT community is confused about why they link that group with them.

They said they were not annoyed at me.

My argument #3
I said that, I don't exactly like all religious people, and I don't exactly like all atheists, it's not that religious people are automatically good.

Most people are not, they say that they are good, but they don't act like it, most of the time I keep an eye on how people act, not what they say they are.

I don't think that we can just replace religion, philosophy suggests that it can replace religion, but it could, it would have probably done it already.

But I'm also not the best one to talk about this, since I'm not sure how to point that out to be honest.

And I don't expect everyone to be religious, people are going to be different, that's just how things are, and it's better this way.

I wasn't saying they pedophile argument as a thing against my friend, I was arguing it for them, because if that is also related to mental health, or physical health, then all this argument can also be thrown at the LGBT community.

My Friend's argument #3
They said that, people who deal with the whole weird sexuality issue, are supposed to see therapy, and it's usually how the diagnosis starts, and eventually find out what kind of “issue” they are dealing with.

But things have shifted in a bad way recently that people just bypass the whole therapy process, and just decide what their “issue” is.

And that things, are getting mixed politics, religions traditions, and all sorts of things, and that does not help with all the problems in the west.

People say things, and act another way, and they are extremely hostile towards other ideas, and things are just all over the place.

But they know that there are questions that need to be answered, and that people need to also figure out.

Ending on good terms
At this point the topic was almost done, we exchanged a few more points, how that things need to be discussed properly, that people need to be left alone, and their lives should not be threatened for what they believe in.

Good friendship
I think my that my friend is a good person to be honest, for me at least they seem to act like they are a good person, and really enjoyed talking to them,

At the end we still are friends, and I guess that's what I like about them, we don't exactly agree, but we still can exist together in peace.

I'm glad to talk with you, my friend, and I hope you're doing well.
Take care.                        </p>

                            2022-01-January-23-Sunday

I've been trying to keep on practicing on my prayers, haven't been doing very well, but it's better than nothing, I'll try to pay more attention to them.

A bit worried
But also been a bit nervous about things like the future still, working towards fixing things is good, but the more I know, the more I know I don't know.

This makes me unable to know what I should learn, what should I work on, and how much I should on projects, it also gets me thinking that I'm not learning fast enough.

Things being complicated
In programming, there are a lot of things to learn, and so many ways to do things, because of that there are so many technologies to learn, standers, best practices, all sorts of things to keep up with.

Doubting my ability
And I'm not sure if it's just me being slow, or that everyone is just much faster than I am, but I take so long to make things that work well, and are usable, where to me, it seems like others take much less time to get those things done.

It gets me thinking sometimes that this “rode”, is not from me, and I probably have to change profession, but I still enjoy what I do, and I have things that I want to with it in the future, and I'll try to be more efficient with my learning and practicing.

Plans for near future.
I'll try to finish the whole permission system after I'm done with the next exam, or maybe before it, but I'll try to do that in one day, where I actually make the system, and put it to test, and see if it works the way I want.

The positive side
I'm still improving, things are getting better, I'll keep on working on my self, and what I work on, and make it better, I'll keep on polishing my work, and maybe someday my hard work will pay off, in one way or another.                        </p>

                    <h3>Distracted, and taking the right steps</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2022-01-January-20-Thursday

Today I was trying to work on something but, I just got ... distracted let's say, well it was my masturbation problem again, it's been terrible the past week.

A possible solution
I do remember when I used to do my prayers, this problem wasn't a thing at all, so what I'm going to be doing is got back on it again, and make it a habit, it may not be the solution for the problem, but it could be one of the factors to solve it.

And today I action did one of the 5 prayers I'm supposed to do, and I'm going to try to stick to this as a habit from now on, I do believe in my religion, so why not actually do my duties.

I know it well have a positive impact on me anyway, so its good to pic things up again, and try to stick to them.

Wasting time
I still spent a lot of time laying in bet today, it's very cold around this time, and laying in bet helps me stay warm, and it's comfortable, and once I was in there, it was really hard to get out, cuz my room is very cold, and I didn't want to lose that warmth, and I ended up wasting about 3-4 hours.

I think I have a weird relationship with warmth, I keep seeking it a lot of the time, I'm not sure if that's just a human thing, but it amplifies the feeling of comfort, and it makes it easier to sleep.

Improved mood
Even tho I wasn't productive at all today, I actually had a pretty good mood, I'm thinking that things are improving, Going to try to work on things more now, but for what ever reason I was also tired today.

More things to document
I've been thinking of also including things that I consider a side activity that I usually don't document at, and I'm thinking I'll be documenting my day with more details and see how it looks, I'm gonna try to do that for a month

Making food
Today I tried to cook sheep foot, about 6 of them, it's basic, just prepare some spices (salt, mixed spiced, paper and curry), and basically u boot that in water, with onions if you like, and boil them for 2-3 hours.

I tear some bread into small chunks, leave them on a large plate, and on the side I mix yogurt with some tahini sauce, and one lemon juice.

I'm not sure of the portions here, about 6 spoons of yogurt, 2-3 spoons of tahini sauce, and one lemon juice.

After it's done boiling, we add the broth to the bread chunks plate until they all have absorbed the broth, add a little of the mix we made on the side on top, and one of the feet

One of my favorite dishes.

Messing things up
But this time I didn't put enough water, and boiled the thing for too long, and all the water evaporated, and some of the feet got stuck to the pot, wasn't a total lose, I added some water boiled it again, and it was fine, even tho I lost some of the food.

The result wasn't too bad, but I have done it better.

Low productivity
I think it was mostly a fine day actually, I'm going to try to be more productive, in the following days, but I'll try not to be to harsh on my self, I still have finals that I need to focus on.

Things might improve, and I hope that they well.                        </p>

I didn't do much today, was still mostly thinking of things and at some point I was talking to someone where we had some sort of “debate”, didn't go anywhere exactly, but I wouldn't call it a waste of time either.

Some sort of work
I tried to work on the project today, and things I didn't really do anything I was just looking around and refactoring some code here and there, but nothing was added to it.

After a few hours of thinking things through and after asking some people about some stuff, I decided to use the idea I had about the permission system yesterday, and I was planing to implement it today, but I got distracted with the whole “debate” thing, and to be honest, I don't think I got my brain in a good spot to actually get things done.

But I know now how I'm going to make things and how it supposes to work, the problem now is to actually do it, which I might have to forget about for a few more weeks, because of finals.

Debate ?
I'm not really sure how we ended up debating about anything but, we were to talk about something of how we would go about solving some of the world's problems, and we ended up debating about the whole idea of (The ends justify the means), which I don't agree with.

My problem with that approach of solving problems this way, is that it would deem any action to be valid no mater how cruel, unethical, or destructive it can be, it would be valid because the goal is good, so any action well be seen as good.

Which I believe is what happened in Germany, Russia, and is happening in China, and their argument, yeah it was bad, but this time It's going to be good, because the end goal is good.

Which is also an argument that have been used in all of those situations, the end goal is good, so no sacrifice is too high, and we will do anything to get there, and what happened is that, hell broke out into those situations, even tho you would expect things to be getting better, things always went worse when the (ends justify the means).

What we ended up at is that disagreed on few things :

In their view the collective was more important than the individual person, while for me the individual in my look is of the highest value
In my view, I trust that the individual can get to a better solution than the one we might just come out with as one person, their argument was that it would take a long time that it won't be worth waiting
In his view, the end goal is worth sacrificing a lot of individuals to achieve it, and in my view we need to let the individuals to decided what their fate should be.
A problem with their argument, life was ultimately meaningless, and that since and rationality, has and answer for everything, and social structures decide everything, while I lean towards saying since are tools, but they can't find values, and values are derived from religions, and most values to this day are almost the same as religions used to be.
There is also a problem with the meaningless argument, and better for the cosmos argument, is that in the bigger picture, it all doesn't matter, so trying to fix things or prolonging it, won't prolong the universe live span for example, so either we solve problems or not, it does not matter, so why even bother with it, in that way of looking at things, why don't we just destroy our selves.
This argument I didn't bring up, we argued that the world is becoming less religious in some parts, and we notice that the families, and value Systems are destroyed, and big values have moved to the political spectrum, and chaos has broken out, and people are panicking to find meaning for life way more than before, and because of that, the society is actually destroying itself.
Trying to help a friend
Recently I've seen someone who is in a very bad spot in their life, and I recognize the situation to be something similar to my struggle, and so I try to offer help, and we talk about a bit, most of the things are personal, but they seem to have lost motivation to do things, and that can break someone's well to live.

I talked to them a bit, they don't see that things well improve, and I wish I promise them that things well be better, but I couldn't, but I told them I'm welling to help with all I can, and they said they appreciate that.

They seem to be harsh on themselves too, which is all too familiar to me, combined with all the things going on with their life, I'm not surprised they didn't feel ok, I tried to tell them things, but I also told them it's not me giving a solution, but more of a suggestion, and I know that things that works for me does not westerly work for everyone else.

At least I could offer them to listen, which they did share some stuff, but they were tired and went to sleep.

I hope I was able to help, and I hope that they will be fine.                        </p>

I'm writing this a bit late, cuz I kept forgetting to write this yesterday.

problem solving
I was thinking of a solution for my permission system for my project, and I didn't totally made my mind on it but I might use the idea which goes something like this

Idea
I had this idea while i was looking at discord role system

basically having 0 for the highest role priority
and allowing the user to change the order for every other role except for the that main role I'm gonna be calling the Root role
and based on the order , roles are going to have numbers lowers based on their order


admin :{
  role : ["admin","user"],
  priority : -2,
  actions : ["del","post","edit"],
  resources : ["Users","Uploads","Announcements"]
}
// those are things like data bases for example,Users for example includes all the users of any role
// the admin role here should be able to delet a user, but because of the priority is sorted the admin role can not delet a user with the mod role.
// and it can't create announcements but it can edit them only if it was made by the same user or another user with the a lower priority 

mod : {
  role : ["mod","user"],
  priority : -1,
  actions : ["manage","post","timeout"],
  resources : ["Users","Uploads","Announcements"]
}
// here the mod, cant actually delete other users, but it can only manage them ( change the roles they have for example, they can make announcements
// the mod  can create annoucements, and cant be deleted by admin ( cause of proirity number ), and technically mod can timeout both users and admins 


user : {
  role: ["user"],
  priority : -3,
  actions : ["del","post","edit"],
  resources : ["Uploads"]
}
// here the usre technically can only create its account, and uploads and can edits its own uploads but it cant edit other user's uploads, cuz they are on the same priority
I asked some friends but couldn't get an answer from all of them, which is fine, I'll be thinking more of the solution, and hopefully implement it tomorrow.

Over-thinking
So the problem with yesterday is that I was just thinking all the time, I didn't do anything, cuz I was just absorbed in my thoughts, was mostly me thinking about the future again, a bit of anxiety, some of it was about solutions, other parts was about the past month and my mental situation, not sure if it got better or worse.

Grateful for what I have
I was thinking about how things were going the Past month, I was really down mentally and I think I was really lucky for having good friends around, I don't really know where I would be without them, I just know that things would probably be worse.

Thank you, for being good to me.                        </p>

No productivity
I didn't do anything today unfortunately, I was only thinking of how to make a Permission System for my website project, I'm still not sure how to do it though, It's all ideas floating around.

Empty
There is still a a general feeling of emptiness in throughout the day, probably because I haven't really worked on anything in a while, my room is still messy and needs cleaning, I'll be trying to get to work on my project again soon.

Nervous
I'm also a bit nervous cuz I have a final exam tomorrow, but I haven't studied for it, even tho I really don't need to study for it, it's just a basic programming skills test.

Some peace of mind
Much more peaceful day to go through at least mentally, I did talk to my friend today, and we talked about general mental stuff, told them that I'm disappointed at my self, cuz I'm not doing much at all, and that I know I need to be doing work, clean my room, and take proper care of my self.

Messy brain
But it's like I need to clean the mess in my brain first before I start acting, I'm planing to clean my room in the next 2-3 days, depending on if I do get time or not, Finals are here, and I need to be studying.

Communicating
I also talked to another friend haven't contacted for a while, told them I wanted to communicate much sooner that I did this time, but I just had a pretty tough time mentally, and I'm not sure how to act on things anymore.

A valuable relationship
They said they are glad that I just checked on, they understand that it wasn't exactly fun for me recently, and told me to never give up, things get tough sometimes, and it feels like too much, and they do understand, but they told me as soon as I can, I should keep on going.

Things to look forward to
It was great to communicate with them again, and I'm kinda looking forward to communicate with them again, I'll be trying my best in the near future, hope that things be fine in the next few months.

Maybe I'll actually release my project in the next few weeks.                        </p>

                            2022-01-January-16-Sunday

I have been avoiding to write my diary for a while now, it's been almost a month since I last wrote anything in it really, it's been quite the struggle, it still is a struggle.

The struggle never really stops, I don't believe it should ever stop, if we don't struggle at all, life is just too boring to live.

But sometimes I get a lot of it, that it feels impossible to overcome it, and that's what happened, and I believe is still happening right now, I'll try my best to write about every thing that happened in the past month.

It didn't go from doing great to being miserable in one night, it sort of got bad, then it got worse and worse over time, and I was already in a bad place around the time I stopped writing.

Rage
So this situation happened quickly, it's similar to what I described in Terror of the monster within diary few months ago.

This time it was with one of my sisters, the younger one.

History
So I honestly hate my sister, even tho I try not to hate anyone for anything, I'm still not perfect, but I have a lot of reasons to be resentful towards her.

As kids, We kinda fought a lot, and what I always noticed about her is that she never ever got punished for anything bad she did.

I remember one she bruised my hand, I remember it hurting a lot I thought it was broken, cuz it's been broken before.

My father toke me to a hospital, and told me

Quote
if they ask you what happened, tell them that you just fell and landed on you're hand.
We dont want to end up taking this to court some how

When we got back, no one said anything to her, it's like she didn't do anything wrong at all, this happened in multiple forms and way, she was always abusive, disrespecting, annoying, and self-centered.

As I was growing up trying to be less aggressive towards my family - even though sometimes I think I have every reason to be so-, she was growing up more and more arrogant and disrespectful.

But basically what I did is that I minimized my interaction with her to almost nothing at all.

What happened
What got me mad this time, is that I was already in a bad place, she comes to my room door and “knocked” on it telling me to take my clothes out of the washing machine, well what triggered me is that she did that way louder than she should have.

It was a bit startled and told her not to knock this hard again, and she still was being rude back to me and disrespectful, telling me to shut up, and going around saying "I don't have time for you're shit".

Anger building up
I almost snapped and told her that she better shut the hell up, or I will attack her.

She continued to be disrespectful, and I basically held her hands, pushed her to the wall, and told her, that I'm welling to ruin her life if she doesn't shut up.

I let her go, and she then attack me, and my mom get in between me and her, I remember throwing a plastic basket at her, it was very light, so it didn't do anything to her.

A promise
She continued to be rude, and started to make fun of my appearance, and I told her, if you anything like that ever again, I will kill you for it, and I wouldn't mind living the rest of my life in jail.

She went to her room, I did my laundry, and continued the day as normal, however later that day my father was there to confront me about what I did to my sister.

He told me that I should never do that ever again Cuz he says so, but I told him, that I will definitely attack her if she continues to be disrespectful weather he likes that or not.

I told him that he better tell her to stop being a spoiled brat, if he really cares if she stays alive.

Injustice
And that was it, she didn't get punished, he didn't tell her that she's being disrespectful, no one told her that she did anything wrong.

Resentment
This theme of things happening this way, is very present int my whole life to be honest, people getting away with abusing me all the time.

And when I defend my self, I get punished for it, and this build a lot of hate and anger in me, makes me want to seek revenge at all cost, to inflect endless pain and suffering on those who wronged me.

Makes me almost afraid that if, by any chance, I get the power to required I would be as bad or even worse from the people I hated.

Sadness
Around the past few weeks, A general sense of Sadness and hopelessness has been present in my thoughts all the time.

Low well power
This makes it hard to think of what I need to next, or acting on it, The sense of low energy coupled with almost no well power, makes it almost impossible to get even the simple things done.

I haven't cleaned my room since I stopped writing my diary, and to this day I still haven't done that yet, partly because it's too cold for me to do that now, but also it's because I can't find the well and energy to.

Falling behind
Not being able to work, I end up just setting there, leave today's work for tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after it, feeling even worse every day I don't do things I think I should be doing, like studying or learning or working on my project.

Breaking the loop
Weirdly enough, the whole thing of me not having enough energy or well power to do things, then getting more upset and less energetic for not doing those things, Is a very strange loop that can only be broken by action, and me writing this is at least an attempt to do that now.

Depression
Being sad and tired all the time usually end up with me thinking that I'm just alone in this and that I'm probably bothering others around, with the whole idea that people around don't really care, which makes me even more hopeless.

So I keep thinking that I should isolate my self, cut my friendships and relationships with everyone I know, fearing to see the evidence that they really don't care, knowing that it will hurt me even more

Overloaded
Sometimes it really thinks I just have a lot of things that I need to do, and it feels like it's just too much to handle, and I'm not sure if it's just my imagination, or that I'm just weak and need to work more on my self, or if it's genuinely a lot to bear.

I know for a fact that when my father dies, I'll be technically the head of this family, simply because I'm the " eldest son ", I'm gonna have to take care of the family, I'm gonna have to take care of the house, make sure it keeps working.

I'm gonna have to make sure that everyone here is happy and doing well.

I'm also expected to maintain my relationship with my father's and mother's family as an introvert somehow.

And whether that happens or not, I'm expected to succeed in UNI, and I'm expected to find a good paying job, and I'm expected to provide my family.

I'm also trying to somehow move out, live by my self, and I'm planing to keep on learning and working projects so that I have something to help me generate some money to save on the side just in case.

So the expectations are also coming from me too, not just from parents or society.

Need to relax
All this makes it almost impossible to for to relax sometimes, and when sometimes I just can't work or do anything productive or learn anything, it's like torture for my mind.

I know I need some way to let those ideas go, and just let my brain rest a little, but I just don't know how.

Down with the sickness
In addition to already feeling like shit, I also got really sick, my headaches from after university were getting worse, and I started to have less and less energy feeling cold most the time, and I also got a runny nose.

Health getting worse
That kept happening and getting worse for about a week, got to the point where All I can do, is just go toy university, and then lay in bed for the rest of the day.

Exhausted
I would just spend my time doing nothing when I don't have to go you Uni, then just go back to bed, cuz I can't find the energy to do anything productive really.

Speaking my mind
Not enjoying my activities
Being in this state it became hard for me to find joy in anything that I do, games, shows, work, and sometimes talking to people, no longer help me get through tough times.

Makes me want to push away from doing anything at all, and all I want in that state is just to lay in bed, and try to sleep for the rest of ... time.

Talking to Friends
Since I'm technically spending most of My time on the PC, and I'm almost constantly online, one of my online friends noticed that I'm not really having a good time.

They started to invite me to watch stuff that we usually watch together, in a more private server, happened for few days.

Good friends
When I asked them why are we not doing that in the server that we usually go to, they said, cuz you're not feeling good recently.

I also talked to that same friend and another common friend, and they told me they won't mind me talking, and I did speak my mind a bit.

One of my friends did try to cheer me up, and it kinda did work, but I also didn't like it that much, Cuz I just wanted to be able to talk about what is bothering me.

They said that they don't mind, but they don't know what to say when I talk about real problems, and they don't want to seem dis-interested or say the wrong thing and make my situation worse.

But I told them that I usually want to talk about things, cuz I just want to be able to talk about it with someone, and they don't have to say anything back.

Speaking my mind
And I ended up talk about how I see things, and my hopeless situation, how my life went and how it affected me.

I talked about me feeling like I'm just stuck being dependent, jobless, and feeling like a loser the whole time.

My friend said that I should not give up, and they are right actually, and I know that, but I also told them, that the way it went in my most things in my life.

Struggling with failure
I always tried to be a “good boy”, I tried to make my parents proud, but for most of the time, all got was, being compared to my older sisters and other relatives.

Constantly being reminded that I'm failing and that I'm not enough, always trying to change to the better, but also they didn't give me any window to fall short at all.

It always seemed like they wanted me to change immediately, which is impossible, further punishing me for even try to be better.

And not just my life in home, it was also in my school, other kids always picked on me, I got abused in all sorts of ways.

It got to the point where almost everyone in almost all my classes was abusing me in some way or another, and being raised in a way where I was taught not to fight back.

I couldn't do anything for a long time until I just decided to actually fight it back, but it didn't stop it.

Falling into hopelessness
Making me believe in that I'm just a loser, and this is still haunting me to this day, I still think this way, failing almost in everything : socializing, education, also being having no talent, feeling that I'm just an unwanted burden with no hope to improve.

It makes it really hard for me to even try to improve and just makes me really depressed and feeling hopeless, and the fact that for my whole life, I didn't really get any kind of “victory”, I don't think I really ever “won” anything.

Always been told that I have potential, and always falling short of even being close to my expectation. Facing loss too much, will just make me not want to “play” anymore.

On top of that, not being able to talk about my problems, or them not being even considered, makes it seem that, no one actually care about me or my well-being, unless I'm useful in one way or another.

Scared of the future
And all this, make me scared of what my future have to offer, thinking it's all down hill all the way, and that makes the whole process of trying to improve my self pointless, cuz no mater how hard I try, I'll always fail.

Beacons of hope
having good friends
I spoke to another friend recently about how things been with me, and they told me that they know it's tough for me, and they would like to help, that maybe the solution is for me to try to do things again, struggling through it.

They say that they do think it will help me get though this tough time, and it probably gonna be worth it for me in the end.

Struggling though
Maybe it's things are going to get better, Maybe my work well pay off, at some point I'll keep on trying, I'll try to get back to work, and maybe try to workout again.

I'll try my best not to not go hollow.

I know that at least having good friends around make my life worth living for me, makes it bearable, and I want to keep on trying, till I taste the victory at least for once.                        </p>

                            2021-12-December-24-Friday

Wasted Day
I was planing to work on things today, but I ended up just playing games and trying to stay away from the communities that I thought I belonged to.

I was just trying to have fun, without much luck really, playing games but not really enjoying them, just passing time, so I can move on with my day, sort of keeping my mind away from my problems and my sadness that been experiencing.

Meeting people
I ended up talking to few friends that are outside any communities that I was in, was fun to talk to them again, we caught up to what we are up to, and how things are going, I didn't share my "incredible" mental state with them.

They were fun to talk to and did help me forget about my issues for a bit, but I decided to leave a bit early so that I don't end up bringing my issues, they were having a holiday So I didn't want to just ruin that for them.

Spending time with my Best Fiends
I met my one of my Best Friends today, that asked to download some games for them few weeks ago, and I kinda ended up forgetting few times, but I got did it in the end, and gave them the games today.

When they showed up they told me another friend of ours is coming today, and asked me if I have any free time, I was actually excited to hear that, although still overwhelmed with sadness.

But the 3 of us have not been in the same place in a long time, and it's once-in-a year chance to get sometimes with them.

Like the old times
And we decided that it was too cold outside So we spent all the time in my room, still was enjoyable, even tho I thought I could have prepared the room better, but they said they didn't mind its current state, and they seem to actually mean it.

We caught up on what we all are doing and our plans for the future, Even thought I wanted to share my problems then, I was actually enjoying my time, and decided not to say anything about it.

Heart-warming event
I'm glad I got to see them again, and I'm hoping that I well meat them another time, hopefully soon.

It helped me a lot to spend time with them, it's like my problems were not there anymore, even tho I didn't even talk about it, was very heart-warming, even tho We haven't met in ages, We still are as good friends as we were back when we spent a lot of time together.

Thinking of my relationships
The feeling of being ignored that started yesterday, is overwhelming today, I don't think was able to ignore it, it was actually being louder and louder in my brain.

Doubting the state of my friendships
Then I thought to why that might make me sad, and I remember one lecture about kids and play time and how being wanted/unwanted to play with dose affect the kids future heavily, and it they were unwanted, there isn't much that can be done to solve the problem.

And I thought it could be the reason I'm sad about not being invited to play, and maybe it wasn't too unreasonable when I got really sad about not being invited.

Maybe it's not too far from an idea, that if others are not inviting me to play, it also means that they don't really want to spend time with me, which means that they don't really want to be my friends.

Probably that's why I always feel like I don't belong to any group really, apart from to my IRL best friends, where they seem to enjoy spending time with me.

Important realization
It's probably that people are actually hints that they don't really want to spend time with me, but I'm probably the only one there, or probably I'm the most annoying, so they can tolerate me for a while until someone else that is more interesting comes around and the just leave.

It's possible that I'm just not really anyone's friend from all of the people that I know and enjoy talking to, and it is very sad if I'm going to be honest, but if I am the problem, and really there is not much I can do to fix it, maybe I was wrong with trying to make friends and trying to be social.

I'm not saying that I'm blaming people for it, maybe I'm just really not compatible with anyone, and that's just how it is, and I'm gonna have to live with that.

A tough choice
So I've been again thinking of just most my relationships that I made online, and just leave things behind forever, it could be better for me if just do that.

I won't get close to people, or at least I won't think I'm getting close to people, only to find out later on that I'm actually not desired, saving my self some time and effort.

It could end up with me being more productive, focusing more on reading and on my career, and probably building more hobbies, or maybe just getting better at the ones I have right now.

Or could just keep going with it and maybe things can end up being not as bad as think they are, Cuz there is always the chance that I'm right, but also there is always the chance that I'm wrong.

Still not sure
Whatever the decision is going to be, I'll be silent about it, if I decide to leave, I won't tell anyone, if I decide to stay I won't tell anyone, I'll just do what I think is the best for both me and people around me.                        </p>

                             2021-12-December-23-Thursday

Lack of work
I didn't work on the project today, I went to university and only got 1 one lecture, And it wasn't the Algebra, one of the 2 lecture I look forward to, and the teacher didn't show up today.

Being behind
Algebra was something I thought would be easy to keep up with but, I'm kinda falling short of where I should be, and it's mostly because I don't practice at home and i just work on my project most of the time, if not all the time.

Exhausted
Kinda annoyed me a bit, but on the way home I was planing to work something today, but I didn't, what it ends up doing is just laying in bed doing nothing.

Masturbation problem
My masturbation problem got worse the worse my mood got, and I know that I go to it as a way to cope with bad times, but the thing itself ends up causing me to feel ashamed, so it would not solve that problem for me, I really want to stop, I'm not sure how to do that, but I'll try my best.

Trying to do things I should be doing
Been thinking, maybe if I pick up my religious duties again, they do help me a lot in maintaining a relatively balanced mindset, and also help me stay away from things I regret doing afterwards.

Things looking worse than they actually are
Feeling unwanted / ignored
I saw a bunch of my friends playing a game I suggested we could play together, and I was not invited, I was looking up to play something with people I enjoy, Since at some point it doesn't matter the game, it's the company that does it for me, at least most of the time.

Kinda made me think, maybe it's not that they enjoy my company, and I could be just the person who happens to be around, they probably don't mind it, but maybe also they do not prefer it.

Too pessimistic
I was joined by a friend at some point, and we talked for a while, and eventually I ended up saying that I'm not feeling good recently, and that I'm very annoyed by my current state.

How I look at my self as a failure/looser, not seeing any way of my state getting better in the near future or the far future.

Thinking I'll be stuck in there forever.

They said that I'm being too pessimistic about how things are, and that what I'm doing now is going to be good for me in the future, and going to help me at least not be financially dependent.

Heart-warming statement
I remember saying "why do you ask?", and they something similar to this "because I care about you bro", this was something I wasn't even hoping to hear really, it's great to know that there is someone that actually care about my well-being.

I really hope it's true.

Pointing inwards
I can't blame them for that, It's not like I can force people to like me, neither that I want to force people to do anything really.

Although it hurts, at least a bit, when I think that people I consider good friends, would prefer spending time without me, it make it seem as I never really belonged to the friends that I'm trying to get close to.

Reflecting
Maybe I'm getting attached or just because I've been emotional recently and also because of my very pessimistic look on everything, Probably perceiving things to be worse than they actually are.

Also, maybe I was just expecting things, and that's probably why I'm feeling bad about, disappointment is kinda of a killer of joy, and maybe it's my fault for expecting anything to begin with.

The aftermath
I'll try not make that affect the relationship we built, I hope I'm wrong on my look at things, but I also know that it could try not expecting anything from anyone, which is what I used to do.

Feeling sad about current state
This whole state of things :

being behind in my studies.
Not performing very well in my project.
Not doing as much work as I would like.
Not being skilled enough.
Being very dependent.
Unsure of what the future is holding.
not sure what direction to take.
Being unforgiving towards my self
And watching all my hopes being too far away from my reach, or having none of my desires fulfilled.
It all leaves me in this ... disappointed, sad, kinda depressed like state where I'm just too affected by my mood to event do anything, Or work on my project or even enjoying a game.

It's ... hopelessness that takes over me, it's not like I'm running out of options, it's like I even have no choice, All I can do is just watch all my hopes, goals, joy and fulfillment burnout, and there isn't anything I can do about it.

Maybe I just should set back, let it burn.                        </p>

Today I started working on the project, trying to fix it and reworking it, and now I have an idea of how to I'm going to do things, and it seems simple, but usually doing simple things sometimes can turn out to be more complicated than I expect.

I managed to get a few things done, things were a bit hard to get done, and I know how I'm going to do the rest of project it's going to take a few more days.

Not much else happened today.

Guilt
I'm noticing that I'm kinda getting distracted from working a lot, I think it's because, me trying to spend time with my friends, and I think I need to limit the time I spend talking to people

And I start feeling guilty as soon as I stop working, and I know that can eventually lead to me working long hours and burning my self out doing my project, but I'm not sure how to go around it.

I'll try to get rid of that thing, so maybe.

Trying to get away from work
I did spend time around my friends and eventually just decided to get away from way, I started feeling guilty as soon as stopped, but some of my friends say that I just need to relax a bit about getting things done.

I'm trying to have fun but, I don't think it's working, I still tried to get work done while I was with my friends, but I didn't get far.

Maybe tomorrow I'll do better, but I also need to study algebra tomorrow, so maybe I'm not going to work on the project at all.                        </p>

Today I tried to work on the project, unfortunately didn't do much, I had trouble getting things done, and eventually ended up with getting nothing done, and the conclusion was that I need to re work my program. it might take a few days.

The doomer mentality
I've seen a video about what we call now the "doomer", which is a term referring to a person that has lost hope in his/her life, mostly a male, and in a situation where they see themselves are losers or failures.

And that the problem in what most of what people do to try to help the "doomer", is that they sort of look at his/her problems from their wont prospective, other than looking at it from the "doomer"'s prospective.

And in a way or another, that could mean that they don't really want to help the "doomer", they just want to appear to want to help.

And the problem of the "doomer" is, people would suggest solutions for him, but what they don't see, that the "doomer" can't see the value of what they might get from that "solution", because the "doomer" situation is way more complicated than just one solution.

They just don't see the complicity of it, the "doomer" can see the possible value of those "solutions", but those "solutions" well require a different "situation" if you well or "environment" for them to actually show any kind of improvement to their life.

there probably is a way to "help" the "doomer", but it's not not going to be easy

I kinda wanna talk about this topic sometime soon so I'll just add it to a to-do list                        </p>

Today, I sort of was a bit more energetic than I am usually, which is good, I wanted to do some work on the project, at the beginning it was ab I hard to get things done, and make sure it's working as intended, and things worked as I wanted it to for the most part.

I'm going to try to make it better, of course, but that gonna have to wait a bit, maybe a few months later.

There are fewer problems to solve, only 2-3 max, I can see it, the end of the road.

Better mood
My mood is improving, I'm kinda having an easier time going through the day, and I'm not as emotional about stuff, but It's still there, and it's annoying, but I guess it's going to decrease and go back to normal, It's also not affecting my productivity as much.

Something to write about
I want to talk about the meaning of life and having purpose, I actually think I can write about it, I also want to talk about it in the next podcast, I really want to write stuff sometime soon, I'll see if I can do this.

I sent something to my 2 of my friends today, and I think it could be used as a material for a blog about the topic.                        </p>

Back to work
I decided to play something first thing today, and then I started working, Technically I didn't really get too much done.

But I was thinking of ways to solve problems I'm dealing with, and I also was thinking that I could probably refactor some of my code and get rid of repetition in it.

I got few things in mind I want to do to reduce the amount of code in the project, gonna make it easier to understand and document later on.

Trying to learn
While working, I was listening to a video about Islam and the possibility of peace, the video/podcast is basically a conversation between 2 people with 2 different ideas.

And I can say that I learned few things from it and I am more "open" if you well, to learn more about my religion and other religions, talking to people, and try to make peace with them despite all the differences that we may or may not have.

I really appreciate that despite them having different ideas, they maintain respect towards each other, I think that's increasingly rare to see now days.

But it gives some hope for things to actually get better

Things to think about
So in that interview/podcast one of the people said:

Quote
Maybe the better we are, the more we like each other

it got me thinking that maybe it is the key for peace

is just trying to be a good person, and in my own experience that's how I got to make, and keep the current friendships I have now, I maybe different than my friends, but we still try to be good to each other and that's probably what make me like them, and them like me.

And if we keep on trying to better our selves, rather that bettering "other people", we could achieve peace on a larger scale, maybe whole communities.

I should try to better my self, be good to people, and hope things go the right way.

And now it's something I kinda want to write about later in the future                        </p>

                            2021-12-December-14-Tuesday

I didn't get much sleep today, I slept at 2 am talking to my friend, still being somewhat emotional, actually even more so when I'm tired and about to sleep, I sort of find it easier to say things that I normally would not say, as it kind of doesn't go with how I do things, not my style if you well.

And I also had to woke-up early, today, so was pretty tired when I came back, I also noticed that the video I uploaded had a problem in it, so I had to take it down fix it, then render it, and then upload it again.

Rendering the video takes a lot of time, and I sort of couldn't really think well, cuz I was tired, so I didn't work, but I also couldn't play anything, cuz my pc was busy rendering the video.

Tried and emotional
Since I couldn't work or play anything, I decided to lay in bet not planing to sleep, I messaged my friend again, still in the weird emotional state, and was amplified by the fact of me being tired, I did speak my mind, to them.

Most of what I sent them is my uncertainty of why I'm in this emotional state, they were welling to listen which I appreciate a lot, and I did try to say that to them, they sort good to me, and I'm not sure why, usually I don't expect to people to be good to me, regardless of if I was good to them or not.

Eventually I fell asleep, and I woke up 4-5 hours later, I video was done rendering and finally uploaded it to YouTube, and it looked and sounded the way I wanted, so that was good to have.

Keeping up friends
I also message a friend that I haven't been able to talk to in a while, and we texted each other a bit, and they said to me

them
I'm happy to talk to you, but I feel that you have been avoidant so I have not wanted to disturb you in any way
so now you are back and happy for that

I did feel a guilty of it, I told them that it wasn't my intention, and I tried to explain my situation, and I apologized to them, cuz I think I could have texted them before.

We kept talking about things, even told them about my current mental state, and also told them a bit about how I feel around groups and such.

Eventually they went into VR-chat, and I decide it would be good if I just join them and Actually "talk" to them instead of texting them, and they talked some issues that they have.

I rather not say them here as it is private to them.

We also talked about some issues I have, it got late, and I just went to bed, tried to talk to my other friend again, Still in the weird “emotional” state, and I fell asleep while texting them again.                        </p>

                             2021-12-December-13-Monday

Today I Tried to work on the project, Couldn't get much done really, but at least I got a few things worked on ... not necessarily done yet, but I'm getting there.

I'm trying to keep communicating with my friend, kinda like talking to them, and they seem to be doing better, and I'm really glad they are, but I'm not sure if I should talk to them about me being “confused” about being emotional recently, cuz I'm not sure its happening, But I'm also not sure how to deal with it.

I also edited the podcast video, Seems like my friend left me a "surprise" in the recording, it was funny, he wanted me to put that in the video, but I also think that I can't really do that, unfortunately it's a bit too much for youtube, and youtube is the only place I publish this video at, Sorry man, but I couldn't do it.

I'm gonna upload it tomorrow, I realized that I rendered the video using the wrong format and it dosen't look the way I want, so I'm gonna have to do that process again.

The complication of life
My IRL best friend talked to me today, and kinda mentioned how he, them and the rest of our friend group, haven't really met in a long time, and that they were planing to meet us, but they couldn't do that, apparently they were trying to save some money and invite me and another friend out on to do something together or go somewhere together.

I told them they don't really need to prepare something this way, we could just try to pull our selves and do what ever we can manage, or just meet and not necessarily do something that require us to spend a lot of money.

But they said that they too miss the days where we used to spend time together, and they realize that this is just how life goes, we all are getting busy, and trying to do our things, trying to make something out of our selves or just build something for the future, or maybe start a family ... life can get us busy.

But we still probably can see each other every now and then, maybe we will do that soon.

I'm hoping things go well.                        </p>

Was planing to work today, but kinda didn't do any work at all, but I recorded another Podcast with my friend today, and it was a bit chaotic, but I also fun to do, Unfortunately we didn't have as much time as I hoped for, We still managed to do more than one hour worth of recording.

Still sensitive
I still feel like I need to talk to someone ... maybe that's how it is like to feel like to want a “partner”, but usually when I get this “sensation” if you well, all I need is to talk to someone about things that bother me, and that would be it for me.

So maybe it's what I need to do now, I might try that in the next few days, not sure if I'm gonna do that now or maybe tomorrow.

I didn't study or read, and I think I should be doing, I still haven't made that damn schedule yet and I really need to actually do it, that would probably make my life easier but its also ... tricky to do.

Hope that I can get things done, and get more things done.                        </p>

                            2021-12-December-11-Saturday

Today, I kinda wasted my time making pizza, the result wasn't exactly what hoped for, but it was moderate, I like pizza anyway, so I don't mind at all, but I could probably do better next time

I didn't work on the project today, even tho the plan was to work, tried to play some games, but I also didn't do much at all.

Improved production
So today I managed to do another podcast with my friend, we went to a new place this time, and they really liked it.
We talk about having some sort of “Ultimate value” kinda like religion.
Wasn't very consistent, was kinda all over the place, but the presentation was a bit better this time.
My friend said that we kinda improved a bit, and they think that we can probably get much better as we keep doing this.

Keeping up
I was making sure that my friend is doing ok today, things been a bit hard for them recently, they said I helped a lot, but wanted to check on them again to make sure things are still fine, I also kinda ... “Opened up” about how I look at them as a close friend in my "eyes" if you well.

And that they kinda taught me that there is still people who well try to help me in a bad spot, instead of kicking me when I'm already down, there is people who well care. To help in bad times.

I told them that they really remind me of my best friend, they are kinda similar in the way they act. And that I really appreciate them both in almost the same way.

They said that they seem me as a close friend and that ... they are comfortable to talk to me about things that bother them, and maybe ask me what I think about something they are not sure what to make of.

I'm glad to have you my friend, and hope that our friendship last.                        </p>

I was planing to work today, but around the time I wanted to start working, my father told me that we're having people coming to install an air conditioning unit in the living room, and that kinda toke all the day.

Day was wasted did nothing, I'm thinking maybe tomorrow but who knows, I'll try.

During the evening I watched a movie with some people was a comedy action movie, was fun, unfortunately I can't remember the movie name but at least I enjoyed it.

Being a “consistent” friend
My online friend seems to still have a hard time, it's kind of a personal topic, but they said that they feel like they can share it with me and ask for my advice, I did my best to be there with them, which seem to help them with their problem.

Glad that they trusted me with it, I guess it's a sign of ... high value friendship I have with this person.

I hope I was helpful my friend, I'll always be there when you need me                        </p>

I'm feeling much better today, I went to uni got back and worked on the project for the first time in about 2-3 weeks, I did some good progress, I kinda finish it, I'm kinda close, hope to finish it before the end of this year.

My mood is very much better than what it was the past 2 weeks too, Things are much easier to get done now, and I'm thinking I could probably get more and more things done.

I also think I'm missing on my Algeria classes, and I'm not keeping up with it as well as I should be, but I'll be able to catch up in the next weeks, so I'll try to focus on it.                        </p>

I had a Much better mood today than the last weeks, and I'm planing to start working on my project again, and actually finish it, I'm close there is I think 2 things to be done and that is it.

Hope things go well.

I'm really grateful for my friends tho, they did help me a lot.

All I did today was just studying for almost a total of 8 hours, really nothing else happened, it was stressful and toke a lot of effort, I'm hoping it pays, thing is making me miserable.

The exam is tomorrow, hope it goes well, but my mood is very bad.

That is it for today though it was all gone on studying.                        </p>

I went to uni to do my exams, went fine, had about 5 hours in between the exams, spent most the time trying to read, I read a bit from the philosophy, and read a bit of the "C the programming language" book that I found in the library.

It's a bit interesting, but I think it's not modern enough, however I still have "the best" book for learning the C programming language, so I might just not look into that book too much.

My mood is still really bad tho, I was supposed to study for the next exam I'm going to have next Wednesday, I'll have to study all that tomorrow, it's the hardest subject, but it's something where I need to remember information, so the thing is going to be a bit tough, but I'll have to manage somehow.

I'm probably going to skip uni for tomorrow, so I can study for the exam, that's going to be a thing I guess.

Hope I have better mood soon.                        </p>

Today went mostly normal, I went to uni, had my lectures, but this time I decided to look for books in the library, trying to find things to learn from, I found few interesting stuff, I found a section about philosophy, a section about physics, a section about mathematics, and section for programming.

Found few books to learn from and decided to put them in this note, gonna try to learn read as much as I can from them with in the next 2 years I have in this university, hope I can learn most of them.

Bad mood
I'm still in a mostly bad mood, I'm not sure what the reason for why it is the way it is, but that's how it's going to be for now.

But thing kinda makes it hard for me to do things.

I think all I can do is hope for things to get better.                        </p>

I didn't work today either, just played games all day, I'm still planing on learning Algebra and calculus. And maybe continue working on the project, but I'm finding it really hard to work these days.

Not very event full day to be honest, all I did is one assignment, but worse mood over all.

Hope next few days well be better.                        </p>

Didn't do any work today, I kinda had a headache for a few hours, that kinda made it a bit hard to do anything, but I did a podcast with my friend, talked about going mad trying to beat death, or in hunger for great knowledge.

And I also uploaded the thing today, but didn't really do anything beyond that.

Planing to start studying Algebra and Calculus again, I also got a little bit emotional today, I don't know why.

But that is it for today.                        </p>

                            2021-12-December-02-Thursday

Went to university today, was a bit late, and I noticed that the car didn't have enough gas in it, and I had no money.

Got that taken care of and I thought I would get there late, but I was there in time, and also was told by my “classmates” that the lecture was canceled, so decided to go to the library and solve a homework for the Algebra lecture after it.

Trying to practice
Solving the problems toke me the whole hour but I think I got the solution right, only to find out that my rush wasn't exactly peccary, cus the teacher said that the homework can wait till next Sunday the lecture went quickly this time for me.

The lecture went quick this time too, it kinda felt like it was only 20 minutes instead of an hour, I like that since i really don't like to spend a lot of time in uni.

After the lecture, I tried to ask the teacher about a few things, that would help me with some projects in the future for drawing and rotating shapes in 3D spaces.

They pointed me to the right person to ask, but unfortunately, they were not available.

I got back home, was really tired, couldn't manage to do anything.

But I spent sometime, talking with my friend, it was fun, really enjoyed there company.

Try to be productive next few days.                        </p>

                            2021-11-November-30-Tuesday

Nothing really happened today, I skipped the first lecture, but went to university, mostly to see the math teacher, and unfortunately they decided that they don't want to give us a lecture today, and you would say, well just go to the office of that teacher, but still don't know where their office is.

Unexpected encounter
So I decided to go to the library, and try to solve some problems to practice for the exam tomorrow, and while I was there I was surprised to find out that one of my old classmates from school days, is in the same university, and they weren't sure that it was actually me -they were not sure cuz of my hair, but they decide to just see- they thought I didn't remember them, but I do have strong memory for those things, party because I really didn't like that period of time and look at most as enemies, we talked for 5 minutes, then they left.

Trying to Stay on track
I tried to keep practicing, did that for almost an hour, then decided to read the "introduction to philosophy" book, for about 30 minutes, then I tried to find something of value in the university's library, but kinda didn't find anything, I might try that again later, but maybe after the other exams are done.

I also asked a friend when I came back about my way of solving problems to check if I'm doing it right, and they said that I'm doing it fine, and I just have to practice a bit more.

Getting out of track
When I came back home the plan was to practice as much as can for few hours and then maybe do something fun if I had time to do so, but that didn't happen, I didn't practice nor played anything, I still tried to get entertainment, but that was still not working really, it's like I'm unable to have fun.

Good friends
A friend reached for me today, I had a status that said "I'm a big disappointment".
they said

them
you haven't disappointed me man, you're chill.

And we started talking about how I see things going with me, things like :

Being disappointed in my self #thoughts
Not being good enough #thoughts
I was in quite a bad mood today I'm not going to like, but they tried to help me through it and it sort of did a bit, even though I still need a lot of time to improve.

Really appreciated that friend , it is kind of heroic.

The nostalgia
I spent some time watching another friend streaming, and We where talking through the stream chat when they get to read what I'm typing for them.

And even tho we were talking I had that weird sensation that miss they, and a bunch of other friends that are kinda still around.

Kind of a nostalgic feeling all the time is the theme for this week, I'm still not sure how where that came from, but maybe I'll figure something later on.

Trying to help
Funny enough

My IRL Best friend asked me if I had some time to talk, they also seem to have a hard time.

And we talked for while too, I tried to help them, to be honest their situation is quite bad, and they have been stuck in it for years, They kinda unlucky, I always wish I can help them, but there is only so much I can offer.

But we talked about what are the available options for them to, actually, get themselves out of that situation, and we talk about that for a while too, and how they can go about it to maximize their options of doing things, and also maximize their chance of solving their problems.

They said that I've been helpful but just listening and offering solutions.

I hope things do get better for them, it will be really tough for a while still, but maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel

Hope things do get better for you, my friend.                        </p>

I tried to wake up early today, but I failed, then tried to start on practicing Linear Algebra as soon as possible, taking few breaks here and there, but tried to keep focusing on actually practicing the thing, and I'm thinking I know how to do most the stuff so far.

I think I made a pretty good progress, but it's not exactly everything I need to study, and the exam is very close, I'm pretty sure that can manage to actually do fine on that exam, I just didn't practice everything I wanted to practice.

working too much ?
After I finished practicing for the day, tried to meet with my friend to ask them about my solutions, but they were not here today, I guess that's gonna have to wait for tomorrow, I'm pretty I'll be able to meet them.

Then I started working on the project that my teacher required the whole class to do for some reason, taking a chunk of my time to re work and fix the whole project.

I tried to finish it as soon as possible, but when I was done, my day was ... over.

I barely had any entertainment today, which for me is a big deal, I try to get my work done early, so I can have fun later on at the end of the day, and maybe enjoy watching or playing something, this kind of helps me, keep my sanity.

But when now it's like my day is gone, and I was planing to read the book again, but I just don't have time for it really, and I kinda have to sleep soon, So that I can catch lectures tomorrow.

If this actually becomes every day's routine, I might get "depressed".

keeping up with my friend
I tried to reach to my friend again, to see how they are doing, yesterday seem to be a bit exhausting for them, I tried to help, but really all I can do is listen to them or maybe say something to try to cheer them up.

Sometimes it works, which is great, but I do wish that I can do more about it, but they seem to be doing better today, glad to find that out, we talked a little bit.

They sort of said that they don't feel like themselves, Which I do kinda understand, what ever happened seem to have an impact on them.

I tried to help them, and I tried to give them some sources that they can probably use to help themselves, hoping that it does help them.

But overall they seem to be in a better mood, which is good.

hope things do get better for them.

Also, it seems like my IRL friend when to the hospital for an appointment or something else, I'm not exactly sure, but they texted me on their way back, they asked if I have free time, but I kinda don't really unless we can do this on text or voice chat.

But it wasn't serious, they said that they were done with the hospital for today, and they are on their way home, but they also mentioned that "everything is blurry" and "I can't read text correctly", which kinda made me worried, they said they well be fine, I hope they are, I sort of forgot to text them after that, so I'm going to do that as soon as I'm done with this diary.

hope they are fine.

I'm still somewhat upset about today and the time I kinda lost, but it is what it is. cant do much about it.                        </p>

I woke up in a really bad mood today, decided not to go to uni, it would be unbearable.

I watched some videos to explain the use of linear algebra, and I found that it would be very useful for me in future projects, so I kinda tried to learn from the book I got from uni, and eventually decided few things :

I will stop working on the project for a while
All my focus will be directed at learning and understanding algebra.
being able to put algebra to use in future projects
make sure that i do get my uni stuff done first
So unfortunately my project well have to wait for a bit, but this could be a good decision on the long term.

I also went to my friend to see if I got my solution right, and they told me that the way I'm solving the problem is right, and I just need to practice more of it, and I'll be good.

So now I'm going to try to document from the book, and try to solve the problems in the book to test my ability to solve problems.

Hopefully going to Document it here too.

true friendship?
One of my "close online friends" , seems like they had a tough time, I'm not sure what they are going through, it seems to affect them negatively.

I asked them if things were fine, they said they have some personal issues, that were serious, and it does effect them.

I told them that they can talk to me if they feel it would help them, it was all I can offer.

I do remember trying to talk them earlier today, and they seemed to be in a good mood, They said something that is "heart warming".

them
thanks for being a good friend to me, who also accepts me for how i am, i never feel pressured or uncomfortable ever talking or writing to you

And i thought, I would be a shame if i just leave my friend suffer when i saw the change in their mood.

But all i could do is just offer them company, and an ear to listen to them.

Told them that, They still can reach me at any time, and I'll reply as soon as can.

They said something that kinda made me laugh, but also has a pretty cool meaning to it

them
now i know what you mean you don't know how to handle kindness

This, sort of, means that, for them, I was kind, to a degree that they probably didn't expect.

It does make me think that I was really helpful even though I done nothing.

But i need to always remember to be humble.

so i tried to say something to try stop my ego get into the conversation.

Me
naah im just a simple man, i try to be good and thats all

They said that they talked to a good friend, and it helped them, was a relief to know that they well be ok.

I hope things do get better for you my friend.

And I will always be there when you need me.

being a good person is commendable??
I remember also that same friend also thanked me, for being a good person

And i does rise the question in my head, should being a good person be complemented.

Maybe its something i could write about in next few days.                        </p>

Today I tried to work on the project thing the teacher asked us for, but didn't document it very well, I don't think I'll give her the project this week, I also tried to solve the problem we got as a homework today, and I think I got most of it right, but there is a bit where I don't think I understand totally.

I'm also still somewhat sad, and I'm not sure where is that coming from or why it is there, it's making it very hard for me to get things done, I can't really play games now, And I'm also very bored, and cant git red of the whole boredom, can't do anything about me being sad and cant be productive, it's been 2 weeks now where I haven't done my assignments very well.

I need to focus on algebra in the next few days, so I can actually pass the exams.
I'll see what happens, But I'm not feeling alright.                        </p>

I did work quite a bit today, the project still needs more work on it, I'm trying to make sure the project can set itself up correctly, I had few crashes with the way I'm doing it, but I think I know why this happens, and how to solve it, I made the solution, but I haven't tested it yet.

I also had my best friend over for almost an hour today, they asked me to help them fix an issue with a laptop of their friend, apparently the thing wasn't even working properly, tried to troubleshoot it, but really the thing just didn't want to work.

I enjoyed having my friend around, even tho wasn't much to say, or to do, the company was great, I'm hoping to seen them again sometime soon.

Trying to do what I know I should be doing
I went to my friend today, to ask him for some help in understanding linear algebra, they explained to me what I needed to know, and then we talked a bit about things I'm still interested in learning.

I asked them if I could come back after few days to show them how I solve problems, and if I'm doing it correctly, they said that they don't have a problem with that, they also offered to show me few question from past exams they had.

It's amazing to that I can just ask people for some things and for the most part they would agree to help with the problem I have, But I would assume it's mostly the people really and not me, and an idea I hope is true.

After I got back I decided to read my book, and try to keep doing this primarily while I'm home, as other than doing it while I'm in collage, cuz I'm thinking that's going to help me build it up more as a habit more than just something to-do while I'm on a break in uni.

I was planing to-do the whole workout thing, but only did 10 push-ups, and really didn't do anything else, I couldn't reach the goal I set for my self for this day, but I guess some progress beats the hell out of no progress any day.

Weird mental state
I'm still dealing with the whole Nostalgia like mental state, thing is weird, sometimes it makes it a bit harder for me to work, but sometimes it just makes it impossible for me to play games.

I don't think it's going to go anytime soon, it's going to stay with me for a while, but at least for now, I can work and learn things, I'm trying my best not to let it take control over me, and make me unable to do anything.

Today wasn't a bad day, but I think it could be better, and I'm going to try to make things better one step at a time, hope it works out.                        </p>

Today was mostly normal, I went to uni learned one new thing, came back and worked on my Project, and I also made Pizza dough, But I didn't do anything else really.

I still think some progress is better than no progress, but sometimes I'm not happy with the current, I do think it's just lack of discipline, But I also know that it makes me not so happy about my self.

Well, at least I do notice it and maybe just noticing it would help me eventually to stop doing what I know I shouldn't do, and maybe start doing what I know I should be doing.

I didn't read today, the plan was to do that while I'm in home instead of uni, I'm going to be trying to do that more, this time I actually forgot about it, cuz I wanted to work more on the project.

Nostalgia getting Stronger
I'm not sure why, but this nostalgic feeling is present almost throughout the whole day for the past week, I'm not sure exactly why, but I have this very strong “longing” for time past, but it's just there.

And the thing is also I'm not sure what is giving me this sensation if you well, it could be anything really, this year specially was probably the most “social” year I had even though it was mostly not in person, I got to know a lot of people on the online world.

And I think I got attached to some of them, I really like the friends I made, and somehow managed to keep, one way or another, it seems like I managed to also form a strong “bond” with some of them.

This feeling could be coming from the fact that I don't get to see my friends in the real world as much, or it could be from the friendships that I didn't manage to keep.

It could be the memories from my childhood, Days I spent with my friends, maybe things that used to enjoy doing that I may or may not enjoy anymore or just can't actually do just cus I don't have time.

What ever it is, it has a mix of happy and sad feeling to it, and it is effecting my mood, and unfortunately that is effecting my productivity now.

What I decided to do is that I'm going to talk about this with my friend in the podcast we're doing and see where this gonna take us, but I'm a bit hesitant that it would make me break down mentally while I'm recording it.

I shall see what happens to this, in the next few days.                        </p>

I tried to do work today, got small things done, but I got distracted in the process, I need to work on avoiding getting distracted, I also edited and uploaded the podcast videos today I made them public, I kinda want to try to go public with the videos and see where it goes.

I'm doing the delete functions, and make sure if someone is deleting a post, the files that are liked to it are also deleted, and also the files linked to the comment inside that post are also getting deleted with the post.

I'm not very happy with the amount of progress, but its progress none the less.

I'm kinda happy that I was able to upload the videos, and I want to keep doing them, maybe going to try to make them a higher quality in the future.

I also think I'm going to need a better microphone for video production and such.

I asked a friend if they would enjoy listening to the podcast, and they said that they do, and told me to send them the link when I make one, was kinda of a fun interaction, makes me wanna keep doing them

Starting to feel nostalgic
Recently I'm just having those thoughts about the pastime, I'm not sure why still, it's just that I miss old days or something, maybe it's CUZ spending time with my online friends, but I'm not spending any time with my IRL friends.

Decided I'm going to try and send them a message tonight and see if they respond, I know that they are busy though, so it's ok.

Maybe it's not really nostalgia, and I'm mixing it with something else.

Not the best mood today, it's not the worst really I'm still doing fine.

I just need to discipline my self a bit more, I'll be trying my best to do more things.                        </p>

I went uni today, felt a bit weird for some reason, and i read my book a bit when i was there.

Good to be back on reading, I still think I need to do more reading though.

I'll try to do that tomorrow, I did nothing productive today so i still have to edit the video I made with my friend.

Also more exams are coming in the next 2 weeks, so I'm gonna have to study for that.

I also need to get back and work on the project, I'm too close to stop now.

I told a friend of mine that I liked a novel that they are writing, and that I'm exited for more, they seem to have liked that.

not much else today so that is it for now.                        </p>

So today was the exam day, was studying for about 3 Days, and I had to go to uni to attempt the exam, things went fine I would, and what I got after 3 days of studying? (18/30).

The new thing is going fine
My friend that I do (The Simple Podcast) with, and they told me that they were free today, and that we could do another podcast if I have time for it, and we did it, I thought I would work on something today, but I was against the idea after I came back from uni.

And the thing went well, We talked about it for a bit before we started actually doing the podcast about what we want to call it, my friend said that they don't really have a name that they feel too strong about, and that they don't mind the name I came up with (The Simple Podcast).

Seems like things are going to work well, We also decided that We are going to make it public too, tomorrow I'm going to edit the old and new video and upload them to YouTube, and maybe some other places.

Future things
I'm getting close to finish the project so, the goal now is to finish before the start of next year, focus more on reading, and once I'm done with the project learn calculus1 and maybe 2.

I'm going to try to maybe make a world for the podcast thing that we're doing, I need to also work on a Logo for the podcast sometime in the future.

Probably should go back to working out every other day, so that I don't get fatter.

Today was fine, hope it's the same tomorrow, but I have to catch on what I missed in some classes.                        </p>

I decided not to go to university today, so that I study could for my exam, CUZ usually when I come back from uni I get a headache, and that usually make it hard for me to work, or do anything, So I skipped today, and I spend my time studying again, till I finished, and played some games with people.

I tried a new Strategy in studying, I Study for about 25 minutes then take a break for 5 minutes, and repeat till I'm done with what ever I'm studying, seems to work fine, studying usually gets me irritated at some point and that helps me to get through it without much irritation in the process.

The exam is tomorrow, and it's making me a bit nervous, even though I did study for it 3 days, but those types of exams where I need to remember things are so hard for me, it's not fun to do them at all.

I'm still in a good mood overall, but I want to get done with the exam so that I can go back to working on my project, and I probably have to focus on learning what ever I missed in Algebra in today's lecture, I'll ask a friend to help me with that, and I really need to get back to reading.

But other than this, there isn't much else today, it was fine and other than being nervous, everything is fine.                        </p>

I spend most the day studying the exam on Monday, I and played a bit and today, not too much happened, but I tried to talk to some people I know about the whole podcast thingy that I did with my friend.

I only sent it to a few friends, They watched some of it, but didn't really give much feed back, But I guess that's fine, one friend liked the name I'm currently using for the podcast “The Simple Podcast”, then we kind of talked about My friend that I do the podcast with, We sort of agree that he would be excellent at voice acting or voicing documentaries or books.


I asked them if they know anywhere that they can promote their “talent”, for maybe some money, but they said that they sort of don't know where they could go with that, This friend is also an artist, they are a musician and they also a singer, they made few songs, and I really think they are good and do deserve more “attention”, but they are probably unlucky.

Then I talked to another friend, they have made a novel, Or they are in the process of making a novel, and they are releasing a chapter of it once every 2 weeks, I said I would like to read it and, So far I read only half of the first chapter, it's interesting so far, I think I might like that and could probably keep reading it.

I also told them about the podcast I made with my friend, they said they won't mind watching it and maybe giving feed back, just to help, but they didn't say anything about, I'm guessing they just leaving it for later, Or maybe forgot about it, it's fine though I appreciate the intent.

A happy coincidence
I decided to spend some time with people in VR-Chat party they're having, and at some point I saw that an old friend had joined me, It was a friend that was too shy to talk, so when I was talking to them, they sort of used a form of “Sign Language”, but I really enjoy talking to them, their company was great to have.

I was really happy they returned to the game, And we spent a lot of time talking, And they seem to have enough (courage I guess ?) to actually talk that time, I was happy to actually, hear their voice, they seem to want to be there again more, they said they were happy to see me again, which is ... hart warming I guess.

I'm really happy this night to be honest, even though I haven't worked in a while on the project, there isn't much left to be fair I'll be done with it before the end of the year, I hope.

but for now things are great.                        </p>

                            2021-11-November-19-Friday

Not a lot of interesting things happened today, I was annoyed mostly when I woke uo today.

for some reason decided to just yank it, i did that twice today, i guess that is interesting.

getting ready
I spent most of the day studying, trying to get ready for an exam on sunday.

And i was trying to get my self ready to talk to my friend again, wasnt sure if we were going to talk but, I thought that getting tasks done early would make easier, but basically all i did is studying.

fixing a problem
My uncle called me again to fix his Pc, he told me that he got few things that i didnt have to fix his pc.

and I tried and failed at first, but then it worked, we managed to make the system boot into windows 7 installer through flash drive.

and managed to install the system, so now its finally fixed.

then i pur his data back into his drive, and things should be restored now.

gonna keep his data for a while, till I learn that things are ok.

The new something
My friend actually sent me a message today, basically asking if i have free time to talk in vr-chat.

I was exited and hopped in, we talked a bit about the podcast idea, and told them im serious about doing it.

and they told me that they are totally down to try it.

so we sort of decided to do the first one on the spot, and i started recording, they probably did record it too.

We talked for a while, and it wasn't the best thing ever, but we both enjoyed it, and they seem to want to do it again.

i uploaded the video un edited to youtube, but kept it un listed for now, gonna send it to few ppl, and see what they tell me.

nostalgic moment
at some point, another friend of ours joined us, one who we did spend a lot of time together with.

we all haven't been in the same place at the same time in a while.

we decided to end recording there, but kept spending a bit more time together, for as much as i could, but i had to leave a bit early.

that was a nice moment of nostalgia that i enjoyed, which usually isn't the case

but im glad how today went it was great

glad i saw you again my friends, hope to see you again sometime soon.

hope you continue to do well                        </p>

I didn't work or study or any workout today.

I just went to uni, cams back from uni, and just played games all day, I was practicing something in the game, and i guess i got better.

But that was kind of all i did today, which made me frustrated with my self.

changing few things
So what I'm noticing is, I have a lot of things to distract me from whatever I'm trying to do.

Like being in multiple communities, and trying to be active in them.

So what I decided to do is to leave some communities, and try to become less active on others.

focus most my attention on productivity and learning, at least for a while.

and hope what ever i get from that is worth doing this.

I need to get moving, and probably having no other activity than being productive is going to help me.

learning to be alone
So, I think I've been around people a lot, and I probably should just go back to spending most/all my time by my self.

This won't be easy though, I might just want to talk to people at some point, and probably gonna have to suppress that desire a bit.

I remember not really having anyone to complain to about anything, or not having people to talk at something that is important to me, or struggling with.

So that also means that I might have to rely on my self doing that.

Instead of asking people to listen to me rant or complain or breakdown .

So I maybe going back to how my life was like 3-4 years ago

Maybe its going to be good maybe not

I'll learn that in the future                        </p>

                            2021-11-November-17-Wednesday

So the plan today was to do work, study something, and workout.

I couldn't get everything in the plan really, I've done my work, but I didn't study, and I did half my workout, didn't really do all the things planned, but I did some.

And I guess that's way better than nothing but still would be good if I could increase my Efficiency.

Possible loss in the future
I decide to rant about a problem I have to a friend.

They said that : they would be ready to listen anytime.

Some people would call that nice, I'm starting to think that's not just someone being nice.
They are sort of going out of their way to offer someone else help, and I think that's more of a “heroic” way of thing.

Now maybe it's not the highest of all, but really listening to people can be a hard task sometimes, and actually caring about what they say is a whole different thing.

Which make me think, I do have good friends on the online world.

But basically I ranted about a problem I have with 2 parties that are my friends.

Where one party think that they can't really spend time around the other, while the other party just was not really aware that they were making the first party uncomfortable.

And I think I might lose some friends because of that maybe from both sides, everything is possible.
But I tried to keep both parties anonymous, only they will know who they are, if they were reading things.

He had a talk about it for a little while, they told me what they think, and I thought, what ever happens I'm just gonna have to accept it, I can't really solve every problem I face.

And I guess I think that I've done my part on that subject.

So I'll just leave it there.

But that was it for today.

I'm gonna try to force my self to more things, I have few things in my mind I might deal with tomorrow.                        </p>

                    <h3>Fighting with the mood</h3>

So I'm writing about this the next day, but gonna keep it about this day.

So the frustration from the last day was still present today when I woke up, I really didn't want to go to uni, but decided to go anyway i the end.

I saw that i had a quiz, i went there and i did it, was really easy, i read a little bit, but that also was way slower than usually, seems like my mood really still effects my production.

Really wasn't a big deal the pas year and the one before it.

I think this year is making me easier to be effected by mood and that's not is driving my productivity down.

So the plan is to do things regardless of my mood, and focus more on actually doing them, regardless of the mood I'm in.

Probably going to be a much better practice for the future I guess.

Being in a good mood is great and all, but doesn't mean I have to be in a good mood to be productive.

And it seems that I'm understanding linear Algebra, but I'm not putting things to practice yet.

I need to force my self to do those things as much as possible.

I think I'm doing pretty well in university for the most part.

Data Structure teacher seem to likely performance, at least he now sees that I understand one or two things about programming.

Which is great, maybe u can talk to him about a thing or two, not sure what that would be yet but ill figure something out.

I did a bit of work on the project today, but I still didn't study, gonna try to force that tomorrow, I'm starting to feel better, so I might go back to working out tomorrow.

Hope some things go to plan.

Yeah i still did masturbated tonight tho even though i want very frustrated at the end of the day.

Need to fight that some how so maybe I need to be more strict my self, and ill try to do that.                        </p>

                    <h3>Frustration</h3>

So I'm writing this 2 days later but only gonna talk about what happened in this day.

I woke up at 8-9 am didn't have uni so decided that I can work till 12 pm
I did that then, turns out we had a relative coming to do Some electricity related stuff in the hours, and that toke almost 2 hours, then I had to clean my room, it toke another 2 hours, I was planing to play something as a break, then study, but that didn't happen.

what happened instead is that my uncle asked me to fix his pc.

I thought, how hard is that going to be?

It was supposed to be a simple case of re installing windows.
that didn't work as planned

what end up happening is this :

the pc was too old that I couldn't get to install windows 10 through a flash drive
I ended up taking the hard drive in the old pc, which was full of dust, and I had to dust it outside.
about 6 years worth of dust came out
then put the drive in my pc to install the system, turns out the drive file system dose not support windows 10.
had to take all the data from that drive to my drive, which toke an hour.
then change the drive file system.
then install the system on my pc, put the drive back on the old pc and run it, turns out that the pc is to old and couldn't run the system.
had to find and older system download it on flash drive
take the drive back out of the old system and put it on my system.
try to install it on my pc, AND IT REFUSED TO INSTALL IT.
then I just kept the new system on the drive, copied the data back into the drive, sent back the pc to my uncle, told him what happened, told him he can get it to run on a new pc, but I really couldn't fix it, and told him the other ways of fixing it, that I can't do; cuz I don't have the items to do so it needs a disk driver, I don't have one, and I don't have a disk with the system on it.
And that whole thing toke all day to get done.

I was frustrated with how much time I wasted, couldn't play a thing, or work on anything else, cuz of the frustration, and cuz it was too late.

And apparently I used this as an excuse yankin it, maybe cuz it's an easy pleasure kinda, but it's bad for me and it's very short term.

was really annoyed anyways when i went to sleep.                        </p>

Today I really didn't want to go to uni, but I just went anyway, trying to stick to a routine, even tho it gets really annoying sometimes.

I'm also still dealing with the headache problem when I come back from uni, I'm still not sure why this happens, but it just does, and it still makes working or studying hard to do almost impossible, one person suggested that I take naps after I come from school, and I would, but the problem is that it could mess my sleep schedule.

I'll try it next time, I have time tomorrow, so I should be able to get some work done, and also study for some exams that are going to be in the next week.

Mood issues
I was in an awful mood today when I started, I'm was really frustrated since yesterday, cuz I wasn't productive in the past few weeks, and I also have hard time to even play games.

I sort of felt like talking today, but I really didn't know what I want to talk about

Reading today didn't go very smooth, the problem is I'm not doing the things I'm supposed to do, Maybe if I force those things tomorrow, it's going to be boring and hard at first but very rewarding in the long term.

A potential for something new
I decided to ask my friend if we can record our conversations and sort of use them in my diary, or maybe use that as a podcast thing, we both had the idea of having a podcast, and I thought maybe we can try do that together.

They said they will be welling to talk about it, they might be on board with the idea, So that might become a thing, but i wont complain if it didn't.

I'm kinda excited to talk to my friend again, hope you're doing well, my friend.

Test results
I got the Covid-19 test results, and it came out "negative", which I was 99% sure it would be like that, but did the test anyway just in case.

Now I have to report that to my doctor and see if I have to do more things, for my current state.

but that is it for today.                        </p>

I was done with fixing my weird issued with my "system" yesterday, and had a lot of time to actually work today, but really didn't do much, All I did is the assignment thing, and it toke me too long when it really shouldn't have taken me more than 1 hour.

But I was done with it for now, the plan for the next week is a lot of actual study for the coming exams, I have to get ready for those, I'm not sure how I'll do in them, but I have to do at least decent.

The thing that annoyed me is that I wasted so much time on it, when I could have done other stuff, and I felt like my day was wasted on nothing.

I also did masturbate today, I could have gone around it and not do it, but it seems like those type of things are smarter than I think, I'm not sure how I'll go around it the next time, but I'll manage, I hope.

I really need to get into documenting my studies too.
Maybe I'll start tomorrow.

but that was it for today.                        </p>

So today I was still trying to fix my system, I'm wasn't sure what happened at first but basically, the scale of icons and such in my Desktop Environment was off, things were too large and couldn't what the problem was exactly.

And just cuz I was too frustrated with how things were, I decided to reinstall my system a few times, and finally found the thing that was causing this issues a few hours later.

It was a setting that was edited in the font section, when it was supposed to be in some other section normally, and what I found is a lot of stuff in the system well depend on the size of the font to sort of “calculate its size”.

It toke all my day when it was supposed to not take more than 30 min of trying things first, So I ended up wasting like 2-3 days where I could have worked on the project, but well, I can't reverse time, So at least I learned one more thing.

Maybe I'll work something tomorrow, I haven't been productive in a while, but probably going to work on an assignment for uni and that's gonna be all work for tomorrow.

We shall see tomorrow.                        </p>

I was able to drive to uni today, seems like I'm gonna be getting better.

Still feel relatively cold, headache is gone, nose is still runny.

It seems like I didn't miss much in the algebra lectures, but I still have to study things that I missed.

I have a lot of stuff in my TO-DO list, and it's gonna keep getting bigger, if I don't start doing them, so I should watch out for that.

I'm getting a bit better, went back to the doctor with the test they asked for, and they want me to do a test for Covid-19, I'm gonna do it in 2 days i kind of don't have time for this.

I spent all day just trying to re-install my system and solve weird issues, but that kinda.                        </p>

I slept a lot today, and I don't have any headache anymore, finally, I can work again.

And I did, I got my solution implemented inside the project, and it worked, I also modified it a bit.

I still have to re factor other files in the project, so I don't run into weird problems later on and also cuz I need the solution to be implemented in there too, I might take time, but it's worth it, and it's going to make the documentation much easier.

I also went to a doctor today game me one medication, and asked me to get a "CBP", not sure why but gonna give it to them tomorrow.

I did spent time with my friends today, had a bit of fun, but still get tired quickly.

and I'm going to sleep a bit early today.

hope I have enough energy to drive to uni tomorrow.                        </p>

I'm still sick, I thought I wouldn't be a big issue, but I just couldn't sleep at all yesterday, stayed up till 6 am
today.

I actually tried masturbate so that I could sleep, cuz sometimes it makes it easier to sleep when I do that, that didn't work at all.

I also found a video that got my curiosity, it was about 2 hours long, it was a discussion about the link between the Abrahamic religions (Islam / Christianity / Judaism ), as well as the differences between them.

And how we use the instructions in them to live our lives. And how do we interpret said instructions, based on what situation we live in.

I watched the whole thing, I enjoyed all of it.

It got a bit worse, so I'm gonna sleep early and hope that tomorrow is better                        </p>

I sort of couldn't do anything today, I was feeling sick from the night before.

I thought that it's just cold and won't be a big issue, but I'm kinda having a hard day.

Not sure if this gonna last, but I'm gonna see tomorrow.

I couldn't work today at all, I had a faint headache, and usually that doesn't effect ability to weak, but I couldn't get anything done.

All I've dome today was re-installing system                        </p>

I did nothing productive today.

I was planing to work after I come back from uni, but I was tired I wanted food and I didn't find much to eat really, tried to make something but failed, I tried using a broth that I made a while ago, and I think it is not good anymore.

I did masturbate today I know the problem can get worse, I'm gonna focus this week on just make sure it never happen again, and keep it from happening again

I also feel like I'm getting sick so that's going to be fun.

I'm still doing fine for the most part.

I also got annoyed at my system a bit and re installed everything again.

Not sure if that's going to be good or not, but let's hope that it is going to be fine.

That's all I got for today                        </p>

Today I got the bug fixed in my project, now chunks do get deleted when deleting the file, that's the main problem solved, I also decided to use fewer collections/tables for storing files data, it would make documenting those things easier, in the future.

What I have to do next is to re-write some of my project, make it look more professional, and easier to edit in the future.

For the most part that was it, I was supposed to work out today, but I didn't do any of that, I don't want to fall off schedule tho, This Week I'm going to try to focus on trying to read more, finishing the project, and actually making a schedule.

I think now I have a clear idea of how my schedule is going to look like for the most part.

So i probably gonna be able to make it this time, and I also have an idea about when I do wake up, and how much energy do I have when I come back and if I can do work or now.

Things are going quite fine, but I need to make sure I maintain them.                        </p>

work related
Today I was trying to fix some bugs in my project, I sort of got close but still have some problems with it, it's not really usable.

gonna try to test more things tomorrow.

The Main event
I finally got to meet my friend, haven't seen them in long time, we met in VR, it's kinda where we like to be and talk, in a place where we used to talk a lot in.

And we did talk a lot today, just like we always used to, its been really fun, and really heart warming.

We caught up in news about ourselves and whats happening with and around us.

We talk as if not much time have passed since the last time we did

We talked about mostly philosophy, and the society around us.

Shared some things that we would like to do but are un-sure how to them.

Some of our plans in the future and memories of the past

It was a very pleasant experience.

one of my best nights in a while

I'm really glad i got to meet you my friend.

And i hope we meet again soon

Just be safe friend and don't you dare go hollow                        </p>

So I was planing to work and do a few things after university today, but none of that happened, I just sat back and sort of relaxed all day.

I don't think it was bad, I was actually feeling good today, spent it talking to my friends.

I'm still planing things in my head though.

my professor wants me to make a project thingy so im gonna do that, but really slowly.

Seems like I'm going to meet my friend in a few days.

kinda exited to talk to them

also my masturbation problem is still a thing but I it's not as bad, might actually get rid of it by the end of next year.

But things are going fine if I just have to work more and that would be great.                        </p>

Not much really happened today, I tried to do the delete function, and I found a bug with the (file chunks)database, the problem now is that the files get deleted, but the chunks of those files don't, and this can easily cause performance problems later on, not to mention it being a waste of storage space, it's also not very practical.

Going to be fixing a lot of stuff in the next few days.

But seriously not much is left, hope things go well

Change in plans
Couldn't wake up early enough to meet my friend today, but later I learned that they also couldn't make, I said that our best shot would be to organize this around the week ends, and they did agree.
I'm exited to meet them.

More improvement
It seems like I'm getting more energetic, doing my workout is becoming easier, my mood a bit better, and over all I'm doing well
I'm thinking of making a tracker for overall mood of every day and see how that goes in the next few months

Really liking obsidian, it's very useful, Soon I'm planing on writing something other than the diary, and also update the website as soon as I'm done.

Might not go to uni tomorrow, it's pretty late, and I might wake up tired enough to not drive.

but that's about it for today                        </p>

                            2021-11-November-02-Tuesday

Today I woke up a bit late for my uni, I rushed out didn't drink or eat anything.

I end up having a faint headache, and I think it could be because of dehydration, but on the good side none of my muscles hurt me, so that could mean that I can keep going with working out on my days off university.

I have few plans for tomorrow, I need to do more testing for the Delete functions in the website, and going to try to start working on the edit function.

I'm also planing on making a linked list data structure, and try to make some Algorithms to apply on it, increasing my Knowledge on the field and probably gonna make it easier for me to find a job in the future.

Good news
My friend messaged me again, and they told me that they would be available in few hours of me writing this diary its (12am) currently, I was happy they reached again, told them that I'm not sure that I would be able to make, but I could actually manage to do that.

So I'm going to try to meet them after I wake up, I'm sort of exited and a bit nervous.

Also, been talking to my other friend recently (the person that asked me for some time), it seems like their problem have been solved, I'm really happy for them, they told me that things look like they would work out well.

It was actually me who started the conversation this time, and it was about how I would show how I appreciate people I really like, And that my way is usually actions, but they also not so obvious ones too.

For me, if I want to show someone that I do care about them, it is usually by just trying to spend time with them, another way for me to show that, is by being there to help the people I care for in the times of need, And help as much as I can.

Sometimes it could be by making something for them if I can.

But also won't be physical about it, some people kiss or hug the people they love, but I don't do that either.

Improved Mood
Recently I noticed improvement in my mood, probably has to do with me having a stable schedule, or maybe working out, or just working on a project, Or probably combination of all of this.
Been eating less and less (something usually do to deal with anxiety or sadness) I think I have a bit more energy during the day, and Stronger “will power” to do things

I'm not exactly sure why, but it is happening slowly

Also, it seems like I'm not falling short of my subjects and things are going fine.

So things been going fine, actually better than I thought.

I did talk to a friend about me not doing work today; because I had a headache, and that I don't know when I've done enough work, and their response was

when you've been to uni and have a headache
thats enough work

They might be right, and to be fair to my self, I've been trying to solve some linked list problems in uni, and I've been reading while I was there, so that's At least some work done.

I'm kinda happy with how today been.

Maybe things are actually better than I thought.                        </p>

I've been trying to work on my website today, I was trying to finish the last few functions of the website before I move in to solving the permissions issue just to make sure that things work exactly as intended, and then take care of the whole permission thing, it should be relatively easy.

I don't expect smooth sailing but I'm gonna be trying to build good habits kinda slowly and maintain it.

Falling short
I'm still not studying calculus, and I'm not writing blogs yet, I'm not reading every day but every other day, I'm a bit behind in linear algebra, and I'm being as productive as I would like to be.

The solution
I'm thinking of spending less and less time trying to talk to people while working, and just focus on working, I'm gonna try to find some time to study those things I want to learn, I'm also tracking my weight and workout. I want to see how or if things change over time.

This well end up with me not spending time as I would like with people I like, could be a good investment for a bit better future.
I'll try to keep in touch, and hopefully I won't end up having another burnout.

My friend seems to be doing better now, and I'm really glad, hope things continue to be fine.

That is it for today, I'll be trying to do this every day again , but i might just fall short of that too.                        </p>

So also not much happened to the day, I'm afraid that I might be falling short of how I should be performing, in uni, and that means I have to start practicing so that I keep up with things.

I'm still working on updating my static website, and It's going to take some time to finish.
But I think I can get it done tomorrow.

Nothing else to report, I still haven't done my schedule, and I'm trying to learn how to use a plugin called Tracker, to keep track of my weight.
And maybe other things in the future.

But I still have no clue how it works, so that's gonna be fun.                        </p>

Small progress
Not much happened today really, I'm working on updating my static web pages on github, but didn't get much done really, I was trying to learn how to make a GIF image with relatively high quality, so that I can show them in the projects part of my website.

I'm trying to fill the documents that talk about the progress of the website and make sure that I wrote them the right way, I'm also planing on looking into what might make my portfolio sort of attractive for people, so I'm planing to use less words to explain stuff, make sure that I have everything on a landing page, and then have the details spread on other pages.

something to do
I'm planing to update my diary with in the next week as I study things and apply them.
gonna try to increase my productivity if that is possible I need to hold on the habits and I think things well be ok, if I can make those things happen.

Interesting news
When I woke up today I saw that I have a message from an old friend, that I was trying to meet with for the past few months, seems like we might have a better chance of meeting, I'm not sure if it will happen, but I did respond to them, and I'm waiting to see if they will say anything back.

Building trust
So this happened around 12 – 1 am today, One of my friends asked me if I had time for them to talk, it seemed like a serious matter, And I responded to them as soon as I could, they told me that something happened to them, that sort of made them feel sad.

That friend was one of the people I would talk to if I felt lost, so naturally I agreed immediately, it was a serous matter, but for the sake of their privacy I won't mention what it is.

We talked for a while, and I tried my best to be a good listener, and I remember them saying that, they were happy that I would be there, and they kind of implied that they think they were right in trusting me.

And even though I did feel bad for them in the situation, I was also really happy that they actually trust me in such matters, and I was happier to provide help, if I was able of it, or at least be there for them when they need me, just like how they have been there for me when I needed them.

It's not like I felt that I was in dept for them for helping me, but really wanted to be as much of a help to them, as they were to me in tough times, and there is something about those moments for both of us, that makes this relationship I have with people, even though it's not in person, it makes it more real than most my interactions with people who I see in person.

I hope that I have been a good company to you, my friend, and I hope that your problem get solved as soon as possible.                        </p>

Not doing anything today, the plan was to do make a schedule, but that might wait for tomorrow, soon I'll be back to work on the project, and probably gonna start learning as well, I'm not sure how I'm going to schedule those, but I'll manage.

Not sure what happened with the turtle, I'll ask my Sister today, been spending my time playing games and relaxing, watching some stuff.

That's gonna be it for now, I'm also planing to update the website on GitHub, haven't done that in ages.

Just learned the news about the turtle, and it seems like the damage was in its head/brain, they were not sure exactly, and that they gonna take to morrow for a shot, and that it might not make it, which makes me sad to be honest.                        </p>

University related
Went to university today, I'm getting used to the schedule, which is a good thing.
Decided to not work today, I'm just going to be writing my diary and putting some notes about what, I'm planing to do for the next week.

We got more into linear algebra, and I think it's going to be easy, but I'm gonna need to practice a lot o to get used to dealing with numbers again, and maybe program my own program to solve those problems.

I'm also planing to learn get back into calculus at the same time, which means I'm gonna have few more activities to manage but, hopefully I will manage.

Sickening experience
When I got back home, I had to move furniture with my father, and I accidentally stepped on a small turtle, and I sort of heard a faint cracking sound, I should have paid more attention.

When I got to check on it, I found that the turtle was bleeding, and it seemed like it was bleeding a lot for its size, I got worried, but I didn't know what to do, I told my sister, and she tried to look up, I tried to clean the blood, thankfully it was responding with some movement, but it was obvious that its in pain.

By now, it is trying to move itself, but the movements are not normal it seems like it can't open its eye, I'm thinking maybe some blood got its way inside the shell and on it's eye, which might have damaged it.

I'm guilty of doing this, if I have paid more attention, this creature won't be in pain now, but you can't reverse time or events, I don't know what to do, but my other sister who we can take it to, and we gonna do that Tomorrow, I'm hoping it's going to survive.

What makes me feel sad about it is that I did hurt a creature that didn't act to hurt to me, it was just walking around, it's not the first time we go have one around, and it's not the first time we move things around it.

I don't want to hurt nor kill other creatures for no reason, if I was hungry for example, I would eat creature mean, but I won't let nor want it creature suffer in the process of obtaining its "flesh", but here I wasn't try to get something to eat, and I wasn't defending my self from great danger.

I'll try to make sure to not let that happen again, I don't enjoy making creatures suffer.

What's next
I'm planing to study and document what I'm studying in the next few weeks, here in the learning file, here in obsidian, gonna be mostly focus on math(calculus and linear algebra) and data structure.

Hope things go well, I'm gonna add some to-do items to make sure I eventually do them, not just forget about them.

I also have to do my schedule so that gonna have to wait till tomorrow.

Hope that the turtle survive.                        </p>

It's kind of early as I make this, it about 10 am

currently, I'm in universities campus, was reading a book I wanted to read for a while.

Kinda doing this only on the days I'm in university now, but hopefully well carry this as habit for every day.

I kind of wanna write about the things I read, so I'm going to be adding a to-do within my diary notes.

And hopefully complete those tasks eventually

This was the first issue laid by the book I'm currently reading.

The book name is (a brief history of thought), it's an introduction to philosophy, a topic that I find interesting, and also a bit hard to fully understand, but is very important, at least to me, it is.

I'm gonna try to see what I can learn from reading it, but also write what I thought about the things I learn in it.

The topic is going to be called, learning how to die

I'm planing to write it some time this week

Things that happened in the past few days
So I'm still moving all my documents and diary from the older program to obsidian, the reason it's taking too long is cuz I'm fixing all the writing mistakes I can find, but also with the help of a plugin for obsidian, that details writing errors.

It's been helping me fix a lot, it does most of the work, I'm glad I have it, cuz languages are very difficult for me.

writing is really a skill i have, but i'm gonna try to develop it along with reading.

planing for the next month
So there is this last problem I need to solve in my project, it has to do with server security, I need to make sure that only the owner well have access to specific information and I don't want that information, obtained by simply having access to the host machine.

So I talked to one of my friends about, and I told they what my approach was gonna be, but I didn't do it cuz I knew it would be bad.

They told me I could use environment variables, but they are not sure how I would keep those safe.

But also liked me an article about web apps security, and I'm planing to read it in the next few weeks.

more things to learn
I toke 2 classes for linear Algebra, and it seems interesting, However I think I need to go back and learn the basics, so I'm planing to learn those things within this week and the next one.

but it seems simple so far

Re thinking my schedule.
The schedule I have now is actually fine, but doesn't work well with my university schedule, so going to make it again today if I don't forget about it                        </p>

                    <h3>Struggling with negativity</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                             2021-10-October-24-Sunday

I've been away from my diary for a while now, and I don't really have much of an excuse to be honest, I just wasn't feeling like getting things done, but also I was sort of un capable of doing them.

I think I had a lot of things that I wanted to talk about in one diary, but I also was focused on getting things done in my project, and I guess I kept trying to solve problems in the project, without much success, and then I wasn't motivated enough to do my diary, cuz I thought I would have too many things to write about.

But I'm going to try to that here on my phone.

Unexpected situation
so this happened on the 2nd of this month

I had a weird one today, I decided yo join my online friends in VR-Chat party , had fun with them for about an hour.

And few of my friends, told me that, I'm a valuable friend of theirs in the online side of their life.

They said some kind word, and I got on the "not what expected" side, I sort of "denied" those words, I don't know why, it's not that I don't like it, or want it.

Sometimes I wish people are more kind to me, but that's just not what I'm used to.

At some point in my life, I just stopped to expect kind words from people at all.

If I ever get a compliment -almost never happens- I sort of makes me blush

I thought it was a shy thing, but my act around it wasn't that of a shy character.

Later I learned that this reaction has to do with some (pray predator) situation that also evolved into society expectation.

And basically I realize that my action/reaction to a situation is not what is expected in society so my brain panic, and to handle the panic, it moves a lot of blood towards the head for reasons I don't remember, and the blood causes the red color in the face.

I still have that reaction and still can't control it, cuz I really don't expect that situation ever.

And I guess my brain panics every time.

explaining my weird reaction towards kindness
And one of my friends asked why am I like that when it comes to them saying nice things to me or about me

My only answer is, I'm just sort of fucked in the head and I guess its too late to fix that

I haven't been encouraged, or been nice too much when I was a child, so I don't know how to handle it

Disbelief towards kindness
Most of the time I don't want to believe it.

But my rule is, I'll believe people until they lie to me.

Once that happen, then I can't believe what they're saying.

The reason I don't believe is cuz I know people can do bad things, and they do that all the time, I do that almost all the time, I'm not perfect, I try to be honest and my friends and family, but I still end up screwing up something every now and them, probably all the time, and I don't relies it.

Missing the old times.
I also go nostalgic in the past days, and I was thinking of my days with friends I used to see almost all the time, and thinking how I can't see them anymore, and that I probably well never see them again.

It sort of gives me a weird mixture of sadness and happiness.

I'm glad for having lived this moment but, the idea of never being able to live them again, is overwhelmingly sad, and it makes me want to cry sometimes.

So what I did is, I opened VR-Chat; cuz that where we used to spend our time with each other, I went to the word we used the most, and sat the spot we used to be at.

And I toke a screenshot of just myself there, thinking about my friends and how much I miss them.

The feeling of uselessness
For the past few 2 weeks I was having sort of a hard time to actually work on the project, It was a mixture of getting distracted, playing games, not having the drive to, as well as confusion to how I would solve some problems.

It was the same as usually happens when I get a burnout from doing one thing too much.

add this to a block in burnouts

Some time open my work space, and try to attempt to get something done, but I end up in a weird state of paralysis, I just stop there either unable to think of a solution or unable to implement it.

All that was happening in the pas few weeks.

Worried of what might come in the future
I was also a bit of anxiety about university, not that I'm just afraid of failure, but also worried about the amount of time I might end up just wasting in university, and gain nothing of value in the end.

My friend keep telling me it won't be all for nothing, and at least I would have a degree that can at least get me a job.

I kind of have no other option, Since I already enrolled the past semester, now I'm at least confident that I can pass university without much trouble, so that's at least one positive side.

My friend also usually tells me that I'm pretty good at what I'm doing and that I shouldn't think about it too much

The problem of over thinking
Few of my friends tell me that I usually think too much about everything, specially the future, and i think they are probably right, It's definitely what causes me to have a lot of anxiety at the end of the day

Few new things
I'm planing to start documenting a few more things

There well be a section related to things I'm learning to keep track of my “education”.
I'm gonna try to document some of my dreams or nightmares in the thought section.
I'm going to stop working on the project for a while till I totally migrated all my diary from the old program to obsidian, that might take few days or maybe the week.
Now I have a reminder thingy, I'm going to rework the Schedule now and see how I can make things work for specific days if that is possible.
I'm gonna try to also write about things I read about in the thoughts section.
I'm going to try to go back to my work-out habit thingy.                        </p>

                            2021-10-October-22-Friday

I didn't make a diary yesterday, that's cuz my sleep schedule is still all over the place

as the title suggests I'm still not sure what I should do with the people I know currently

I still can go "anti-social" without totally cutting my communication with them.

But that means I still would have communications to maintain.

But it also means if I need someone to talk to I'll probably have, and the people I know are not bad at all, I would say they are actually good people, I would love to keep talking to them too, I actually told them that I might entirely disappear.

some of them told me that it's a bad idea, and probably not a good plan, and that they would be sad / upset if I do, but it still would be my decision to take.
They told me that if it's something I need to do, they still respect that decision.

I actually feel like I'm making a too big sacrifice.

I'm going to feel really bad for a few months if I actually leave for good.

I am in a state of analysis paralysis, where I can't decide whether my decisions are good or stupid.
the risk can be higher that the reward in this case, I usually step away from this kind of sacrifice, but it does seem like I'm having some real problems, maybe social anxiety, maybe just anxiety.

I've been dealing with it for the past few years. Well maybe sense I was 10 years old, probably was dealing with something similar to anxiety until it developed itself to what i m dealing with now.

My problem is I'm never sure of anything, which is good for learning things, makes me consider that I might be on the wrong side sometimes, being able to understand people better.

The bad side is
I'm not sure of my relationship with the people I invested my time trying to know, I'm also never sure if I have a “good” skill or not.
or even cable of doing or making something usefully, what ever “usefully” suppose to mean, seems to change meaning depending on the situation.

So people are being nice to me, and I believe that they are my friends, but the problem I'm never sure if anything including that.
I've always thought people in the end would mean me harm at some point, maybe would try to use me for their own amusement.
I'm not trying to blame the past, or the people before, but that was what my experience that led me to believe, that no one would honestly be my friend.

Until my friends actually did convince me that there are some good people out there.
and I sometimes believe that I did actually find them.
and my problem is, that I keep on leaving.
and now I'm thinking, maybe I shouldn't have, but at the same time. It doesn't feel like I can really communicate with all of them, some of them seem to have really good intentions.

Some of them seem to be just there.
and that's fine, i haven't seen any ill intentions from any of them.

that's usually why i don't get attached to people. Now I'm afraid of leaving.
maybe it's time to build a solid platform. A place I can go back to.
probably after that while I'll be able to go back to my “travels” between people.

I can't keep on blaming past, it's not ok to keep on leaving people, at some point I'll be running out of options.

I spent few years learning how to talk, I should spend few more learning how not to talk.
which is actually harder to me than it sounds.

But what would be a good decision, i don't think I'm capable of taking it now.

I'm stuck.

Do I sacrifice all and crawl back into being by my self, Which going to give me a lot of time for development.
But has the risk of me getting into depression again.

I really believe that the people I have now been so valuable that this decision may not be worth it.

Or do I keep on maintaining my current relationships, and hold to my sanity, the risk would be them leaving, that's totally possible, I also tend to think that I might end up messing it up. And have all what I did ruined by me.
Would be funny that I'm scared of making a quick decision, but that's where I'm at now.

I have to decide.

I could always lurk for a while until I feel better about my current situation, it's time to take care of how I feel about something I guess. can't believe I said that.

But I'll also make sure there is room for improvement.

Soon I'll update my personal website.

I'll thinking of buying a domain name and having a server to host my page on.

And things would work fine, hopefully.

Now that I've gotten really good with designing, I think it's time to make a few more templates and sell them to people.

Probably can make a profit out of few templates. Finally .

And that's it for today.

Wish me luck. Who ever you are reading this.                        </p>

                    <h3>Terror of the monster within</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                             2021-10-October-03-Sunday

It's been interesting and a bit scary few days, few things happened that i sort of couldn't make up my mind on how I'm going to write about it, so I put them on wait, but I think now is good enough.

Facing the monster within
Few days ago I had a situation, where my mother got into my room, and she started telling both me and my brother, to stop doing what we were doing and do our praying duties.

I told here “mom, now it's not the time, please close the door.”

She refused, “no, get up now, don't talk to me like that, it's disrespectful.”

I repeated, slightly irritated, “mom, it's not the time, please close the door.”

She refused again, “don't say that, it's disrespectful.”

I repeated, really irritated, “mom, really, it's not the time for this, leave the room, and close the door.”

She refused, again, “don't talk to me like ...”

At that point, I snapped and said, loudly and aggressively, “CLOSE THE DOOR!!”

She got scared and left and closed the door.

What actually happened
So this is going back a long time ago, but I'm just going to give a good enough background, to understand what actually happened.

My religion is Islam, and in Islam we are required to do a lot of things, but the most important duty is to do 5 prayers a day.

And my mom always keep demanding that I do them, and I would really do them, if she leave me be.

How I think things are
From her view she still sees me as a child, and I'm thinking that she's afraid of me growing up, and becoming independent, some people may think that's ridicules, but that's a real condition.

A mother would be way overprotective, that she won’t let her child go outside without her, if they leave she HAS TO KNOW where they are going and for how long, and would mostly be against any acts of exploration, taking risks, or do anything that have a chance of harming the child, and the idea of her child or children leave the house and live alone would be terrifying for her, so that she don't face that terror she makes the child dependent on her, even if it end up making the child miserable.

My mom was sort of overprotective, not to the max but also very noticeable, she wouldn't let me try to do things that are sort of out of the “norm” with my classmates, or just trying a hobby that could hurt me physically, she won't let me play outside with my friends, she would tell me to play with my friend in the house.

At some point I used to go to a karate dojo, I had a practice that end up inflicting pain on me, and I was tarting to think, I don't want to go there anymore, and I don't remember if that even happened, but I would bet that my mom supported that I stop going there so that I don't get harmed.

I remember the master, called my dad and literary told him, if money is an issue, we'll keep training him for free.

Unfortunately I decided to top going.

That decision has its own story, so when I talk about it, I'll link it here.

And she always tries to sort of make decisions for me, try to take control of what I do and how I do it, and when I do it.

Which makes the child dependent even more on the mother to take control, making the child unable to take care of him/her self later on, or take responsibility of anything he/she do.

And she always says, “oh in the future you are going to grow up and probably get married and leave me here alone.”, another sign that she was overprotective, and probably would rather I don't grow up.

situation getting worse
At some point, she was always going into my room, and changing how things are arranged , or maybe do the bed and clean the room, and you would think I would be grateful for that, but there was nothing that could make me even more angry, than going back to my room, after a day of “collage/work” only to find it different from how I left it, and some things probably are lost.

I wanted to do clean my room my self, her doing that for me, is her not letting me take responsibility, and making me even more useless and hopeless and depressed.

So I used to fight her almost every day, telling here don't get into my room, and at some point i told her “I'm welling to burn the whole house with everyone in it, if you get into my room again.”

I still think I probably would have done it, so decided to lock the room door, she cried, which is a tactic that she keeps using to this day, to make me change my mind, that no longer work on me.

She doesn't clean my room any more I do that my self, but it took me a long time to fight here

This been long, but that's what has been happening, I was already a bit irritated, my parents never knock on my door before they enter the room still, she's probably thinking that I'm becoming independent on her now, cuz I know how to clean my room cook for my self, fix some issues in the house , I'm learning to find a job, and I'm not spending as much time with her anymore.

So she has been demanding that I do my prayers, and I get angry every time ,and tell her ,that she needs to leave me be, cuz what she's doing is making me hate doing my duties, and I'll do them my self eventually, she just has to leave me in peace.

She always says that she's afraid that she will be judged for not telling me, and I told her that at my age, and the stage we are, she is no longer responsible for what I do.

And again told her that she should leave me alone, and I would be happy to help her with things that she want from me, but not anything that is only my responsibility.

how things went down
That same day she tried to tell again, and I told her, you're making me even more mad, please leave me be.

And then it happened

She comes to my room, I'm already irritated, she demands that I stop what I'm doing, and do as she tells me, I tell her, it's not the time, and she should leave and close the door.

She ignores me few times, playing on the “disrespect” game, finally snap and shout, "CLOSE THE DOOR"

that shout was really aggressive.

Facing madness
I started thinking , almost 30 min after what happened, about what actually happened.

And for a bit, I was sort of thinking, that was not me, then in my mind I said, no that definitely was me, getting just a little bit closer to madness, that is for sure the part of me that really don't want to take over, who knows what I might have done At that moment, if I was poked even more, or if I just didn't resist the desire of destroying everything thing that annoys me even a little.

That is the part that most people are ignorant of, thinking that they are good people, that won't do any harm, that they won't dislike their children, that they won't harm their significant other.

They say "oh no, I'm not a monster", but as a smart man once said "you are a monster, but you're just an unbelievably naive monster, which is the most harmful type"

I don't want to end up the person who harms my family.

After the storm
So after few hours I decided I have to go talk to my mother, but this time I decide I'll have to do all the talk so that, we don't end up having this happening again.

I told her, that I never want or mean to shout at her, or scare her, but also she needs to be careful with what she says to me, we already had a discussion about that topic, and I'm getting sick of it, and you better leave me be; because of you don't leave me be, I might just go mad, and who knows what might happen then, I might harm my self, I might harm you, who knows I might even end up killing you, we heard about stories like that all the time with other people around us.

you have to be careful when you poke me, I may have patience, but it's never enough to take everything, I know that I should respect you and be nice with you, and I'm trying to be, but you have to help me do that too, please don't just keep on poking me, thinking that nothing should ever happen, and that i should just take that without suddenly snapping , cuz that not helpful and doesn't work

I'll be trying to be more patient, but also you need to respect my privacy, and leave me to deal with my own "business/issues", if I want to talk about it, I'll come to you my self, you don't force your well on me, cuz that well make me resentful, and push me to madness, and god only knows what happens when we get there, but it won't be good for any of us.

I don't want to hate you, I don't hate you, but don't make me.

You have to let us take responsibility, or we will get more and more irritated, and hate each other more and more

Fear of falling into madness
What made me think that I'm sure that things won't end up good if this happens again.

I sort of remember looking at my mother, but it's like I didn't recognize her at that stage, It's as if she was "some random object that is annoying me more than I can endure", and that I can just get up and destroy that object, I just have to get up and start attacking, with the intent to kill and destroy.

I was blinded by madness, who know what I would do after this, and I started to get scared of my self, thinking that at any point someone could provoke me the wrong way, and if I don't communicate that the need to stop, or they refuse to stop, I might end up harming them badly.

Seeking guidance
Then I went back to my room, and tried to sleep, but I couldn't, I wanted to write about it, so I wrote about it to a friend, and we talk about it, and exchanged some thoughts.

It was risky; cuz I never know if they just view me as a very horrible person with that story, and decide to never talk to me again.

And who would blame them for refusing to talk to the guy who shouts very aggressively to terrify his own mother

But they told me that it wasn't a good thing to do, and that I should be more careful around families, cuz families are more complicated than they seem, and they are right.

Mostly focusing on me being more careful, and I do agree, but I remember them telling me, that I should probably apologize, but I said that "i shouldn't apologize, cuz that might make them think that they will get away with provoking me this time, and that they can do it again, and again"

They sort of agreed but they also, said that I should probably apologize but also set boundaries, and keep on enforcing them, to make sure they don't push me far into madness.

I'm thinking of sharing this with another friend, I'm sort of not totally sure what to think about it.

There are few more things I want to talk about tomorrow, a way more bright than today's story.

Looking forward to talk about it.

But that's going to be it for today

Hope that my mom stop trying to control my life, and make decisions for me, allow me to grow up and be less miserable.

And hope that I can be a bit more patient, and probably spend more time with my mom, so she doesn't feel alone, and make my relationship with her better, we already have fine relationship, but may I can make it better.                        </p>

I'm still trying to get things done with the website, work is going slow, it seems like I can't really focus for what ever reason, not new, but also didn't happen in a long time now, and I'm starting to worry that I just lost my ability to focus on a task.

But I got at least something done, which is better than nothing, the project now is a bit more complete than yesterday, which what actually matters.

I also figured that I'll change something in the design a little bit and I'll try to design a “pop up” that well be used for editing stuff content instead of doing some weird magic to take care of it I'll design a form that appears for the user to edit content on, I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to do that exactly, cuz I want less JavaScript in my projects, but I'm probably gonna have to do it in JavaScript.

I'm also still doing the daily workout thingy my friend suggested we all do, and it might end up as habit.

And I'm experiencing an overall mood improvement, it's kinda strange, but I guess I'm doing something right.

talking about those things is easy, and keep it going is probably going to be harder than i think.

but so far it seems like i can handle it.                        </p>

                            2021-09-September-27-Monday

I was supposed to keep writing my diary yesterday, but I sort of forgot to keep doing that, I had something that I wanted to talk about, but I'm going to talk about it in this one instead.

But only after I'm done with today's work, things seems to be going fine, there are some things that I'm not sure if I'm doing right or not, but I'll keep on working, there isn't much left to do, and I might actually finish working this week's

So I'm done with work, kind of o toke me too long to do very little, I'm not very happy about it still, I'm probably a bit rusty and need some time to pic up some speed eventually.

So about yesterday, I had my best friend coming over to my place, we haven't really seen each other in a while so was kinda fun, but also there was terrible news, they have been to a hospital for a while now, seems like they have a lot of pain in their stomach, and according to the checks so far, they seem to have some kidney stone, and may or may not have a Crohn disease, I'm the hoping it won't be that, but according to the doctors it's very likely to be.

Their situation doesn't look really good, and I'm really worried about them, the future still scares me sometimes, I guess that may happen to everyone.

Also learned that one of our friends, ended up having problems with their legs, seems like they were spending all their time working while seated, which is pretty bad, And their parent seems to some suffer from a thrombosis.

Seems like we are going to be really busy for the next few years, I still need to get my life sorted, and headed somewhere so that I don't end up in some chaotic place, I'm still trying to build up habits, and hopefully become a bit more healthy, and lose a bit of weight.

That well be it for today, tomorrow I'll try to sort of finish the “about” page in my website, after that all I'll have to work on is administration stuff.
Then I'll be able to finally release it as an open source, and continue to support it and update it slowly, after I make a good documentation about it.                        </p>

I'm finally getting back to the project, I have few things to get done, i'm not feeling very energetic though

I'll be working in about 5 min, usually I do the diary thing at the end of the day, but now I'm starting to think maybe I should do it throughout the day as things happen.

I don't seem to get up to speed quickly, I almost forgot what I was trying to do, but what I remember is I need to figure out is administration settings for the website, and the ability for users to edit their username, and bio and add a cover and image if they want, and to add things like contact information and skills if they choose to                        </p>

Not much happened today actually, I didn't work on my project, kinda decided to leave it for few days and go back to it later, which is going to be tomorrow, when I go back to working, and maybe put my schedule to action.

I'll admit to that I failed my water fasting plan, pretty badly too .
One of my friend suggested we sort of both set some sort of “workout goal”, for every day, and we could start easy, and scale off that, and I'm kinda down to try that, we're going to starting tomorrow.

I'm also getting a bit nervous about my university and my semester, thinking that I might not be up for the task. Things always seem overwhelming, the thought that i sort of cant afford to fail.

I'm still being overwhelmed by the fact that I don't have any sort of income, and part of that is because of how I am, and part of it is luck and part of it is lack of skills, but it leaves me in a place, where I'm thinking that I could never even make it, that I can't pull my weight, and then someone has to do that, which really makes me think that things would be much better off if I didn't exist.

It sort of push the idea of maybe it's too late to fix the mess that is me right now, or that the solution for me to stop being some sort of dead weight on anyone is probably if just, just end my life, and I know this sounds like I'm looking for someone's attention or sympathy, but seriously, what I am now is just some dead weight, I'm barely useful for people around, and I know that this can't keep going for long, in fact i'ts been going for too long already.

I still need to try to improve my self, and try to end up being something better the next day that what I am tomorrow.

But also, if I compare my self to people around my age, I'm pretty much a big failure.

And some people would say, that I should not compare my self to people, but also if I don't then how can I measure my progress, am I doing well, am I doing bad.

Also, sort of looking at people that doing fine, while I seem to heading down almost the whole time, kinda makes me resentful, it's not that I want to be exactly like “successful” people.

I'm not sure if I can put that in words yet, but I want to be able to sort of prepare for my future, and pull my weight in the present, and being financially dependent sort of kills that for me.

What I mean by “I get resentful”, is that I get sort of mad, not at people, but at my self, and at the situation, then my focus sort of shifts everywhere, and I start asking a load of questions at once.

Was it the way I was raised?, was it my parents?, was it my classmates ?, was it my teachers ?, is it just me, is there a fix for that is it possible ?, is the solution even worth pursuing now?, is it too late, and I should give up ?.

The way that happens is also sort of, frantically like I want my answer and I want it now, and I want my solution now.

I don't seem to be heading somewhere good too, I'm not sure how much I can keep up with this sort of mentality before sort of getting mad at my self and take my own life, or maybe get mad at other people and maybe take their life, and people might think that I wouldn't be this “cruel”, people won't believe that they would be this “cruel”.

Everyone has the capacity to either be the best person to ever live, or the worst person to ever live, and people who are ignorant of the fact that they can be monsters, can end up being the worst monsters.

For now I won't give up, I still can keep madness away, and maybe things are going to be better in the future, I know I need someone to talk to, but I'm not sure who that person should be, I have options, but I'm not sure who to choose.

Some people kind of ignore what I'm saying a bit more than I like it to happen, some people point focus on the wrong stuff, some people try to decide what I'm saying instead of listening, some people just can't put up with my problems and have their own problems to deal with, and to be honest that's all fair.

Maybe I don't deserve that anyway, for whatever reason that maybe, I'm not a perfect person, and I won't say I'm a good person too, I try to be, and that's all I can say.

I'll try to keep doing my things, and let things happen and hope for the best

I'll see you next time.                        </p>

Hello diary, I've been sort of busy, I've done some work on the website.

Last thing I did on the website :
is making the ability to comment on uploads, and updating uploads like blogs and projects, so that they can contain more than one "upload" within them, I also made the ability to comment on those "uploads" inside the blogs and projects.

Reason I made This; to allow people to make updates on the “progress” of that blog or project so that people can avoid multiple different uploads discussing the same issue

stopped for a while :
then I stopped to work on my room, party my idea, but also only got to do that cuz my father wanted us to do it too.

We re-painted the room, and I'm pretty happy with the results, I got to choose the colors, and it was 1 wall purple, and 3 walls gray.

This is the room before we started painting

</p><div class="images"><img src="./img/IMG_20210917_205457.jpg" alt=""></div> <p>

And this is the end result

</p><div class="images"><img src="./img/IMG_20211104_173110.jpg" alt=""></div> <p>

I'm pretty happy with how it looks I don't think I would change it, it looks way different in camera tho, it's probably cuz I'm using my phone, it doesn't really have the best camera in the world.

That toke us 2 days to get done, was supposed to take us only one day, but I guess things didn't go according to plan, but it's fine.

University update :
After we were done with the room, I went to my university to sign up for the next semester, which is going to start in 17/10/2021, the process didn't go as “smooth” as I thought it would, what I did is I went to the professor who is the head of my “section”, and they were really helpful, and sort of found out that, I'm in a weird situation.

I had almost all the “basic” (subjects/courses) except one, and i sort of didn't have many options to what I can sign up for that semester, and I would end up taking only 2-3 (subjects/courses), which is not good it's almost like waste of money and time at that point.

So they explained to me what I can do, and sort of got the point of where I could take 2 subjects, where one of them depend on the other, but that I can also study both of them at the same time, sort of synchronously, and that I can request an approval from professors from other “sections” , to sign up for some (subjects/courses) that have been taken off.

Things didn't totally go well at first, and I had to go around almost the whole university, which is kinda small for what you expect for a university.

Toke me almost the whole day to get things done, ended up with the professor sort of personally explaining what situation, helped me a lot with solving the problem I was facing that day, I'm not totally done with everything, I have to still go back to them on the first day of the semester.

And things seems to be going fine.

Hoping for things to go well.

I'm starting to get nervous again, but that's probably cuz I haven't written my diary or worked on my website for a while, so that maybe why                        </p>

hello diary i'ts been a few days I've been sort of trying to work on my project, my productivity is still actually really low esh , considering that I'm just messing around mostly doing nothing, trying to learn but not really it's kind of like my burnout stage, but I'm still actually having fun working on the project, things are looking more clear of how much work left I have to do, and it could take me few days before I'm done with the first few things, later on i'll try to upgrade the project add new stuff and make it more efficient or secure, things are looking good, and I'm happy about it.

new text editor for my diary
So I've seen someone talking about this program called Obsidian, and first when I saw it, I didn't know what I would do with so i sort of always ignored its existence, but that did change, when I actually tried to use it, basically it's a knowledge sort of storing tool, its both a text editor and sort of manager for your documents, things that you would write down, I'm not sure yet, but it seems like its open source, but the cool thing about it, it's free, and it stores things locally, its basically what I was going to make. So I guess that means I might now do my Text Editor project, and gonna have to find something else to play with, I'm not sure what that thing is going to be yet, I'm gonna need sometime to come up with something that I'm going to use.

About the new text editor
Obsidian seem to have everything I want, it has a lot of plugins, people can make their own plugins and publish them for free, anyone can make a style for the app and also modify an existing style. It still in early development, the good thing about this application is that it can link “documents/notes” within the app “vault” so things can be connected which is going to be interesting to try, this might actually make me take writing a bit more seriously, and possibly improve my typing skills and writing skills, would be great to link all my thoughts and daily activities sort of to gather and see that weird network, of how things are sort of connected in this weird complex network of thoughts, and probably going to push me into learning and reading more things and writing them down.

It also can display images and store sound recordings, this would be an example here, that I might use later on

And every thing in a document is connected through references I'm going to try to make those “links” between documents, I'll try to use these things in the best way possible, maybe I could also try to contribute to it in the future, I'm not sure what I might add here, but I'm sure I can think of something eventually.

So what's in the future .
I'm looking forward to learning C and probably C++, learn actually programming as some people say as web development doesn't about a lot of programming if you work on the front end, and I'm also getting tired of using JavaScript, the language is actually fun to use tho, it's pretty easy to learn and very useful, but i sort of want to dive into the more “complicated” stuff, and C seems like the right language to do that with, I'm excited to get start, but it still has to wait for a while, I'm currently working on fixing my sleep, hopefully I'll be done with that problem with in the next few weeks.                        </p>

I'm sort of still moving slowly in the whole rebuild thingy, the but toke me longer than I would like to admit, but it's solved, now that's out of the way I'll go back to rebuilding every thing, and making sure that it's build way better than how I did that last time, and sort of speed up the process.

I'm thinking of making the videos about the project, and maybe streaming it, I'm also going to work on uploading videos to the website, and also maybe encoding and re-scaling those videos to have them available in multiple resolutions, the problem is going to be encoding those videos is going to be a heavy task on the server, so for future planing, the encoding should be on a different server or VM, so that it doesn't affect the website.

It's looking pretty fine the past few days, seems like things well go well in the next few days, hopefully it does.

Should spend a lot more time on work next few days, things should go fine.

The project is still close to finish m maybe in the next 2 weeks it would be done.                        </p>

So unfortunately I couldn't get any of my data, so I decided I'm not gonna waste more time on it, I'm gonna try to get my shit together again, and work things back, now i sort of can back up everything almost every day, I'm going to sort of do that from now on.

The goal is to finish it before this month, I still remember exactly what I want to do and how to do it, I learned things, unfortunately also lost almost a whole month of diary, some of it on my phone and of it on my website, I'll copy it back on my PC and spell check it tomorrow, and probably work on things kinda get my website back to where it was, make sure that fix the bugs that was there, cuz the bugs I fixed are back now, cuz that backup is a bit old.

I'm a bit disappointed and really sad about it, and it kind of discouraging, but I have nothing else, I can't really give up, and probably can get the progress within this month.

Sometimes I see my life being difficult, but I do realize I'm really lucky, and I think are pretty easier for me that a lot of people, I still realize that.

But I also realize that, sort of, the mentality is probably really similar to anyone struggling in the world now.

And I also realize that I should take this chance to fix things before it's too late to fix this situation, I'm not going to sate it, it would a disrespect for the people who built this, and probably for my self.

In the words of a great person,
“there is no point in getting resentful”

Hope things go well.                        </p>

So for the past 2 moths I've been working on the project almost every day.

I was making a lot of progress and fixing a lot of problems, getting things done, things were almost smooth sailing for 80% of the time, pretty unusual that I was thinking wait, things are going a little too well recently, what's going on, and I think I jinxed my self.

A BIG mistake
I ended up loosing all my data from the past 2 months, some of my diary is gone, almost everything I've done on the project for the past 2 moths is also gone.

How did that happen
this happens as I was trying to install windows on a ssd for my brother, cuz his laptop kept refusing to install it, in the process and may have accidentally tried to install it on my own drive somehow ( I'm really not sure if that's what happened )

I'm not exactly sure how but basically my data was gone, I tried few methods of getting that data back, but no results                        </p>

So I'm still trying to get my website done, but I decided to work on another feature (following) which is following people and blogs and projects, I'm not sure how this is going to be handled exactly, but that's gonna help a bit later on if I decided to make a community thing, but I'm not very happy with my progress today, its like its never ending.

I still have to work a few more stuff, but those are easy to do ... I hope.

I'm water fasting (this failed measurably), I'm not sure if I mentioned that before, it's almost my first week
gonna keep doing it for like 4 weeks.

I feel like I toke a hit in my confidence for some reason I'm not sure why, I'll try to totally finish that feature tomorrow
I'll see if I can finish it this week.

I'll hope for the best.                        </p>

I still end up questioning my skills and ability to get things done.

I start thinking that I'm slow at doing things and that I'm not good at it, and that I'm really slow at learning that I can't make things in time.

Sometimes it feels like I can 'give' things that I don't have.

I remember helping a friend to have a better look at something they were doing, their skills were not as good as they used to, and that's due to them not practicing for a long time, told them that they should do what they enjoy, and not care a lot about their skill, as it well improve with practice, so all they have to worry about is practicing and enjoy it.

And here where it comes to this weird thing I have, where I don't really apply the same logic to my self, I like what I do and enjoy it, but still really pessimistic over my skills, thinking that I'm too slow or just inefficient, and even though I'm improving, it always feels slow.

Thinking that I won't be able to have something of value in time, maybe it's a combination of not having a job, feeling useless, not having an income, being dependent, and feeling like a burden.                        </p>

So I'm still working on the project and things are going surprisingly well.

I managed to upload projects to detect the user who uploaded it, And now every project have it has its own page, And it also can have updates within the page, people can comment on both the main upload
And the updates within it.

Now the plan is :

add some simple moderating tools
The ability to edit and delete the posts
And the ability for the owner of the website to make people able to post or comment, and what kind of post they can make, depending on what type of "user" they are
and the ability to make other users admins or not

blocking specific people might be a thing in the future                        </p>

hello, good to be back to my diary again, I've been sort of lurking from doing it, being all busy with learning and trying new stuff.

how you been, I've been fine my self, made some progress here and there, things seem to be going well for me.

I still haven't made a video yet but my brain is bugging me about it, I want to talk about things that are of critical value of my life.

But I always stop my self, saying that I don't have enough knowledge to talk about such things.

But who cares I want to exercise my brain, and I should probably exercise my body too I'm fat af,

the project is close to first version of beta, I'm not sure where it well go from there but it's almost done.

There is still some potential for upgrades.

I'm glad for what I learned, and for my friends that helped in the time of need.

I only hope that I'm not much of a burden on them
but tomorrow well be the day I'll try to get enough courage to talk, or the day after actually.

We have ppl coming over, and I have an appointment with my dentist, and I still haven't totally worked out everything on the project.

But I will start, and I'll talk about

Finding purpose

A thing that bugged me for a long time still does, and I believe a lot of people do sort of struggled with, one way or another.

Also I found out I have a lot of teeth that need to be repaired

And that process is gonna take some time, but I'm doing it early, which is good.
I'm still not reading as much as I would like to
It's because I'm not scheduling it properly

My sleep schedule is still a mess and ill try to fix it but first want to finish the project

And I'm closer than ever to do that                        </p>

                            2021-07-July-25-Sunday

So in the past few days, I actually start working again on the project, I sort of did very simple things, just some simple bug fixes, I removed the whole span as "textarea" thing now it only resize when there's more than 5 lines in the "textarea", it does the same thing for the comment section when there is more than line.

I also found a way to figure out roughly how much characters needed for a whole line, and also found away to detect new line characters.

And it seems to be working nicely , I sort of started on looking at how I'm going to make my upload progress visualization, it's gonna need few steps, requesting to upload pictures, keeping up with the progress, making sure that progress is saved, and detecting when progress is done , I'm gonna have to learn (XMLHttprequests) for that, it might take me a week just to learn that alone, I'm probably gonna need to use self invoking functions, I'm not sure exactly how they work, but they seem handy, for separating data / functions with similar names, kind of putting them in categories in some way.

Wasn't all good, it seems like my masturbation addiction is still a problem that I deal with, almost 2 times a week, I'm not sure exactly how I'm going to over come it, but I can't just avoid addressing it, that would avoid a solution, I know I need to stop I just don't know how I'm going to stop my self, and it's not going to be a one solid solution that works for everyone, who knows what's going to work for me I'll just hope I'll get there.

I'm also trying to only work for 4 hours a day on my project, and nothing more than that, it seems to be good thing, now it does seem like I have more time during the day to do other things, I actually started reading again, I'm hoping to read 10 pages everyday, and once I'm done I'll try to get another book that my friend recommended me to read.

That friend actually helped me a lot, limiting the working hours wasn't new concept for me, but i sort of decided to stop doing it, and they sort of told me that I should limit my working hours again, and they were right, there were a lot of things that they helped me with, they are pretty good person, and I'll always be thankful for their effort.

If you're reading things, thank you a lot, wish I could pay that back, I shall never forget you ever.

But now things are getting weird, I might have lost some more friends in my virtual world (VRchat), well, I mean I didn't tell everyone about my name change, so maybe that wasn't the smartest move, but I'll eventually tell them, I can't exactly tell everyone at once, its impossible, I'll miss those who I'll lose, but I can't trap my self in that cage forever.

in the book I started reading, it's called "a brief history of thought" by "matthew B.Crawford"

The author discusses that that one of the ways we may lose on life, is that we worry too much about the future, and we keep on feeling sad about the past, preventing us from living the current moment, the only moment we have, and argues that we shouldn't think too much of the old memories even the happy ones as it eventually well turn into feeling sorry for not being able to live those moments again, and that we shouldn't think of the future as we can never really know what it holds for us, and it will set us up to be disappointed when we don't have our expectations met.

This is sort of really familiar for me specially the past few weeks, I was always feeling sad for not being able to have those good days with my old friends that no are no longer available for me to talk to, while at the same time being too worried about the future that I was unable to live the present, wasn't able to enjoy games that I played, work on the project that enjoyed making, or learn things that I'm interested in.

Maybe the author is right, but also I see it hard for me to completely forget the past as it sort of shapes who I am now, who knows what well happen if decide that I don't want to remember a single thing that happened in the past, or even plan anything for the future, my life would probably turn into pure chaos.
so maybe it's not all bad vs all good.

I'm looking forward to read more of that book again tomorrow.

I still had more time on my hands too, I might be able to learn physics or maybe do some other activity, I'm not sure what I'm going to fill that time with, but I'll see what I can do, seems like limiting the time is not exactly the worse thing, I'm not overly exhausted when I'm done, and I still have clear head to play and do things that enjoy, without worrying all the time about what I might do about that one problem I'm having in my project.

Again that's to my friend, they are awesome people, I'll try at least to make something out of this project and make it work, that's the least I can do, not waste their effort.

Usually I think I might be able to live without people, but having good friends really is priceless, hope you are doing well my friend and have a great time.                        </p>

Didn't start working yet, I actually almost did.

For some reason decided I wanna spend most my day wanking, not proud of it TBH, but just did it anyways, it is an addiction, I'll keep on trying to solve that problem, probably the solution is to actually work on my project and do something else

But it's much harder said than done when it's an addiction

I'll keep on trying though, I'm pretty sure I'll find a way out

I wanna actually complete my project.

I'll try again tomorrow.

I'll start by reading as the first thing I do.                        </p>

haven't wrote my diary in few days now
I forgot to do it on my so I'm doing it now as I'm laying bet getting ready to sleep.

It's been a fine week for me was getting a lot better, feel like I can go back to work still I've been only messing around with some useless things that only makes my pc look nicer.

I cleaned my room, got rid of a lot of old clothes and items that I don't use ever.

I'll try to go back to being productive tomorrow so far seems like I'm fixing my sleep, but now it's about maintaining it, I'll try to always wake up at 6 at, ill do that for a week using alarms and after that I probably won't need them.

Not having much luck in finding a job too, so now I'm thinking of learning new things that might help me get one.

Thanks to my friend, I know where I could just go practice these new skills that I might need

I really wanna try to start reading tomorrow, I'll try my best to do that.

Hoping for better days and hope that get better too
I'm grateful for having really good friends, they do help me a lot.

I do wish to somewhat give back
thank you, you all great people                        </p>

Alright so, today I did nothing productive really, I was just messing around with tools, got a new audio visualizer program, toke me the entire day to figure out how to just style a bit, gonna look more into it and see if I can work more things and make look weird.

Seems like they are using (glsl), open gl shader language, seems fun to play around with, might even try to make a similar project in the future, got me excited to learn more stuff, but problem is, it's not actually anything productive for me, I'll try to work on the project tomorrow, but good thing is it seems like I can pick things up again, and try to work on it.

Been trying to meet my friend for a while now, not much success, unfortunately, seems like they come online before I do, and they leave early, so I don't get a chance to talk to them, been listening to a song that kind reminds me of them, for the past few days, feel like I really want to meet them again, but it seems like I'm not gonna have much luck in the near future.

I'm slowly fixing my sleep schedule, and greatly limit the chance of meeting them again, they usually start playing when it's 3am for me, normally I'm not actually awake at that time, unless my sleep schedule is messed up, so also less time for me to meet my friend.

I'm not sure if I can somewhat find a way to meet my friend like probably just wake up really early, hoping that they would be online someday, it's kinda sucks to wait, only to realize that I missed them with 2 hours, but can't really contact them other than that one game (VR-chat), I'll see what I can do.

The main focus for the next week probably just maintaining A good sleep schedule, trying to also make a schedule for the days, focus on working on the project, its getting close to be done, I just want to be over with it for a while I don't want to touch that project for like few months after finishing it, I'll try to finish it before the end of this month, but let's be honest been saying that for 2 yeas, every time I get some problem that needs to be solved so yeah, maybe not this month, but I'll try.

Wanna also try to actually limit the working hours, free up time for other habits, been saying I want to start reading stuff, for like 3 months now, but all the time I'm just busy with the project, which leads to a burnout eventually, we kinda don't want that to happen again, also finally gonna paint the room, I've been meaning to do that for like fukin 2-3 years now, gonna be gray, I don't want a lot of light reflecting, so I'll try to go for some dark ESH colors.

Also, I'm gonna try to make some videos, wanna talk about the project, I actually said that yesterday, there is some stuff on my mind that I want to sort of just talk about in video, and probably upload that to youtube, who gives a shit really.

But sort of might help me just improving at least on presentation skills, I'm not sure where that would be useful for me yet, but I mean maybe in uni stuff

I decided that I'm going with the personalized approach stuff thingy when it comes to any content that I make.

Reading will help me a lot on making that content actually, so maybe that would motivate me a bit at least.

Few steps towards a better state that I was few weeks ago

Hope I can keep it up, without crashing again, I'll just try to do my best.                        </p>

Not much happened again in the past few days still improving, it seems I'm getting to the end of it, I'm planning things to do ahead, I might start backing stuff up.

Might be working on the project today, but I'm not sure what I'm going to do exactly, I'm thinking of actually starting to work on visualizing the uploading process, and also I might start working with C and C++ learning both at the same time, I think I that I can do it, since they are similar on the surface.

I'm also thinking about starting recording things again, and have a start, one that is diffident from what I actually did first, instead of taking the “professional” route, I want to take the “personalized” one.

I know that might affect my professional life, but I don't have one to begin with, so I guess it doesn't matter really, and I also don't want it to be too exhausting to do, I'll try to do things in a way as that shows me instead of showing an act of how I do things.

I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to do, It could be a combination of maybe playing games, making tutorials, talking about my projects and maybe trying to make something like a really short blog I guess.

I'm not sure if I should go with the scripted route, or just the trying, do things on the spot.

Seems like I'm picking up some speed, let's hope that I actually get things done from now on.                        </p>

So actually getting a bit better, might start working in the next few days, get progress done on the project, and maybe finish it in about 2-3 weeks, get something else started, my next project probably going to be a text editor, see if I can make something decent, the goal is to make work on all platforms, with the ability to sync, though a cloud device, that probably means I'm gonna fuk this up anyways.

Talked to a friend yesterday about the weird nostalgia I had few days, and my concern about the future of my current relationships, being wired they won't last, that idea that sort of makes me sad, gets me away from progressing through anything, kinda end up trapped in the weird mentality.

And even tho I know that nothing lasts forever, those relationships well be lost one way or another, my friend reminded me that, while it's fine to have those moments from time to time, it's important to remember that what matters is what I still have in the present moment, and I should enjoy it, and nothing is wrong with feeling nostalgia, just don't make it all you do, cuz that well end up with me being trapped in it.

They reminded me of a text that one of our friends sent in response to me being worried about losing people around me for being depressed and a concern that I was treated badly on purpose, and the text said:

"You are at times obviously depressed, but not so that I at least don't want to talk to you. Everyone is different and deals with things differently, you're just more vocal about it. There's nothing wrong with that.
One thing I can say is that you're not the 'punch bag' it's just that when you're as vocal as you are you become a bigger target. "

Saying that, at least there are few people who won't hate me for being in a bad state.

I expressed how the thought of losing them, makes me extremely sad, and they were understanding and told me :

Even if it happened it won't be the end, just try to enjoy those current times, but it's still ok to be sad, and take my time to get my shit together.

I'm feeling much better now, and hopefully well start working on something with in the next few days, I'll try to focus on the positive side a bit more.

I also change my name from "Darkx97" to “Simple Minded” , I wanted the new name to be both true and false at the same time, cuz I can be very simple-minded sometimes, other times I can get a bit more “complex” I guess.

Looking forward to the next few days, hope it will be better from now on.                        </p>

                    <h3>Messing the past and Fear of what's there to come.</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2021-07-July-11-Sunday

So this is going to be sort of including both today and yesterday, I sort of woke up, also don't remember if I had a dream or not, I was kind of sad when I woke up, didn't have anything in mind really, but I think I was sad cuz the thoughts I recently had about my past relationships and the way they ended, and the chance of it me being the reason it's the way it is now.

I sort of spent all the day listening to 2 soundtracks that makes me feel a bit more sad and nostalgic than I already was, thinking about the times I had with my old friends in the virtual and online world, and the times I had with my friends in the real world, me being happy to actually have good memories with people I liked, but at the same time feeling really sad that I can't have those moments anymore, afraid of the future of current relationship to someday end up with how my old ones did, a memory that I can no longer repeat.

Overwhelmed with sadness I almost cried, thinking that what awaits in the future is being abandoned by my friends because of my personality, that I'll drive people away, being mostly sad and gloomy, feeling trapped at the moment, not knowing what my next move should, overthinking what every small decision would lead to, as the music repeats it keeps the nostalgia.

I met my friends, they were having a party I haven't seen them in a while, so I decided to say hi, sort of show up after being absent for some time, they were welcoming as usual, which was great to be honest, I actually like people being nice to me despite me being all weird about, I kinda of wish that people are more kind to me, but it's not like I can say that.

Met few new friends they seem to be alright people, some of them seem interesting, I think I have a common personality feature with one of them, I like them actually, been spending some time with them too, we did talk a lot, and me being a gloomy person I am, in the weird spot that I'm in, started talking about me being sad, and that end up with us talking about things that sort of bring us down, things we worry about.

End up talking about my nostalgia, started wondering if I still had some pictures from when I was with my friends, and I did, I saw those pictures, sort of tired up a bit for the old times, and for a moment I thought I should get rid of them, but I guess I won't do that, I wanna keep those memories as they are valuable to me, they were not sad ones, what made me sad is that I can't have them anymore.

So I'll keep on those, I'll hold on the memory of you my friends, I'm sad I can't see you anymore, but I hope that someday I do, and if it didn't happen I'm still happy to know you.

Hope you're doing well.                        </p>

So hello, it's been about a whole week without diary, unfortunately nothing much happened, I still sort of can't work on my project, so close to finish yet out of reach, sometimes it seems that I'm going to be stuck in this state forever, I'm not sure what to do from this point, don't have much news.

Today is a weird one, I don't remember dreaming about anything, I woke up really late 5pm, but that's also because I slept at 9 am, so that's about 8 hours, but I don't think I did enjoy it, I woke up with the weird mood, it's like something is missing, or I'm lacking something, and all it toke me today is just to listen to a soundtrack of some game That made me feel a bit nostalgic and sad, making me more worried about the future, more about what I'm going to lose to "change/character development", it's not the first time that I get that, I've been though it multiple times, And it's sort of always the same, I get really sad, because I know that changing require loosing a part of my current self, and I'm a bit afraid of it, cuz sometime, that change could lead to even loosing some of my relationships with people I like now, I fear that I would end up "killing" so much of my current self that I would entirely lose it.

I know that I need to go through the change, to progress through life, not taking it well make things harder, but I'm afraid of what I might lose my self in the process, how much sacrifice is too much sacrifice, I don't really know, what I"m going to exactly lose I'm not sure, what I tend to think is that the current self maybe fine, even tho I'm current struggling to just live every day normally, I always keep thinking what if it wasn't worth it, what's going to be on the end of the that path.

I noticed that,generally my personality is really pessimist, most the things I talk about with my friends are a bit sad, sometimes "dark/gloomy" and this had me starting to think that maybe this well drive those people that I like away from me, maybe I'm just too negative for people to be around me, and that would eventually coast me my relationship with them, and I do think that's probably too much to pay.

For some reason I also started feeling a bit lonely, don't usually get that, but I guess it has its moments, i just really miss my friends haven't really talked to them in a while, been trying to get a hold of my friend in VR-chat but also failed, its more of they didn't actually come online than it being my fault.

Who knows what well happen from this point, it doesn't seem like I'm going to have a very productive week, and I'm still trying to fix my sleep schedule, not making a lot of progress, but some is better than none.

I'm afraid that, I'm probably going to just lose those relationships, they mean a lot to me, but I'm afraid that I'm stupid enough to just sacrifice them, for nothing, or again i t could be just my personality being too pessimist would eventually drive them away from me.

And it's like I can just simply change, it would take a long time, some of my friends say that it's fine the way I am.

I usually say to them

"I'm sorry that I'm always (pessimist, dark and gloomy), I'm starting to think that's just the way I am "

And I end up asking

"dose my personality, drive you away from me ?"

And sometimes I don't get a clear answer, which kind of concerns me, what if it does, and they just like me less every time, up to a point where they don't like me around anymore, and end up losing that relationship that I value too much.

Maybe I'm just worrying too much about an issue that doesn't exist, or maybe I'm too afraid of loss.

I'm also getting into the state of not really enjoying anything, doesn't seem like games are that entertaining anymore, nor videos does it, and I can't get my self into a new habit or activity, again it's more like a paralyzed state that I'm stuck.

All this together is a bit hard to deal with at once, at least it is for me.

And again now I'm thinking if I'm going to lose those "things" that I value soo much, then maybe isolation could be the solution, but I don't really know, maybe I'm wrong in the end, I kind of hope that I am.

Only future well tell, for now I need to try my best to fix this situation, current I'm just trying to fix my sleep schedule issue, while waiting for my friend, hoping to see them one more time.

Hope they are doing fine, and I hope that I find some solution, and get back to my productive schedule again.                        </p>

                            2021-07-July-03-Saturday

Stayed up late yesterday, met some stranger who I think is a friend now, or might be in the future, and I spent like 2 hours tying to talk with them, 1 hour was me talking about my issue I guess, I don't think I was very interesting talk, but they stayed, maybe cuz I had that talk with my self multiple times now.

Stayed up really late, well I stayed too late that it was 6am in the morning today when I slept, was trying to meet an old friend that lives almost on the other side of the fukin planet, unfortunately they didn't log in to the game, but on the bright side I got to meet with another friend haven't seen them in almost 6 months, but was too tired couldn't stick for too long, and ended up leaving early, woke up today at 1 pm, which I found kinda weird, cuz seems like my brain got used to waking up at that time, doesn't matter when I sleep I'll just wake up at that time, I think it's a bad sign and I really need to fix my sleep schedule so that I wake up early in the morning not sleep in the morning.

Other than that I really didn't do anything, sort of got a new hard drive my old one was about to die, sort of clone the old in to the new one, good thing I did that early, losing data would be shit, probably means I would lose my projects, if that happens I'll probably just give up on life, it's all I have, there would be nothing to replace that work.

I'm not sure how I'm going to get my self back into working, or even fix my sleep schedule, but I'm thinking of trying applying for jobs again, and see if that takes me anywhere. Probably won't get any. But at least I'll what the companies want, but in the meantime I need to focus on making something of value, that I can sort of offer as product somewhere.                        </p>

                    <h3>Lack of discipline, paralyzed and confused</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2021-07-July-02-Friday

Well that almost makes to weeks, of doing nothing, I've been trying to get my brain back on a working mood, still failing, it's not the first time, been there before, I'll be able to make it out of it at some point, few things left, and I'll be done with this project.

I'm probably just bored with this project, but I still won't abandon it, I want to finish it and actually use it, once I'm done with it, I'll move to something else, lets hope that it won't take too much time for me to get back to work.

I'm not sure how to get out of this weird situation, it seems like there is a name for it, I forgot what it is and kind of too lazy to look it up, so what's happening is.

Currently, I somewhat know what I need to do to get the next feature in my website done, I don't exactly know how to do the small steps, but I somewhat know what they are, and my brain feels paralyzed there, it's like I want to get things done, but I just can't start doing the whole "alright, let's try something out, see if it works and see if I can use it in my project, if it does what I want or not, then go the next step".

It's weird cuz I had this multiple times, and the interesting thing is, if i someone gave me a task or something like a homework, I'll be able to do that fine no problem, but when it comes to what I'm trying to do, where the goal is a bit vague, I just can't get to work.

This makes me confused and frustrated, and sort of hate my self for it, I'm stuck, and I don't know what to do about it. Looked up some psychology on that topic and, yeah there was a name for it, again I don't really remember the name I'll look it up hopefully soon, I'm still in a weird cycle where I can't really do anything, playing games still doesn't do it for me TBH .

I got frustrated around the people I usually hang with online, I felt like I'm just being treated like a "punching bag" of that group, and it's not like i hate the people, but they really need to give me some peace, or some respect, I can't just take shit all the time, but it is what it is, I'm just trying to be under the radar for a while, and I don't know if that's going to work or not, but I'm in a bad enough share already I don't want to make it worse.

Jokes on me though as, now I feel like a disappointing piece of shit , as I didn't go to a funeral to one of my IRL friend's grandfather, I just couldn't get my self to do it, but I wanted to be there for them, and now it's too late, and I can see how much of piece of shit I am, I don't think I can face them to be honest, I sent them a text apologizing, cuz I don't have credit to call now. Not sure if they want to talk to me ever again now.
Still haven't heard anything from them.

And on top of that I have this masturbating and eating addiction going through the fukin roof, it's like I'm at my lowest point in life, or maybe, just maybe, it could get even worse, I need to discipline my self better, there is a different approach that I sort of liked, which is focusing on doing other stuff, instead of focusing on preventing my self from doing some things, I'm not sure if I'll be able to follow this approach any time soon, but It's an interesting one nonetheless.

I'm not sure how I'm going to handle the next weeks, I'm not sure if I'll be out of this weird cycle soon or not, I don't have anything left but hope.

It feels so shit when I want to be there with my friend, but then I don't because my brain can't handle it, it feels so shit when I have a project that is almost finished, but cant continue work on it because my brain can't handle it, it feels so shit when all I see is the negative side from every single interaction I have with anyone, even people I like to be with.

I also found out that one of my online friend's father has died, and I wasn't so sure what to tell them other than I'll be there for them, and I'm welling to listen to them if they want to talk. Knowing that made me feel horrible about my self, because I was thinking of leaving them few days ago, not just that one friend, but, most if not all of my friends, and go back to isolate my self, but I'm not sure if that's what I actually want to do, I'll take things slow so that I don't make a stupid decision.

I don't want to leave my friend now, they probably need me more than any other time, I don't want to betray them.

I'll try to be a better person.                        </p>

So it's been 2 days, I've been doing nothing, I should have been working on the project but, I didn't even open the files, all I did is, struggling to live the day, it's like a very hard task somehow, getting up from bed feels like a struggle, I don't know what to do about it, if there is a solution for it.

It's not the first time that happens, but when it happens, I just end up waiting it out, I can't really get out of it my self.

I guess I just have to hope that it won't last long, I really don't think games would do it for me, I'm not picking up new hobbies, and I haven't gone out for a walk in a few days now, I'm not sure I'll do that TBH. It's like, my work, is really all I have, and I really want to get back to working on it, it pains me that I can't, but I don't know what to do about it too, I'm stuck, and it makes me sad that I can't get out of this state, sometimes even scared of the future, it's like I'm not ready for it, I don't have enough.

I keep thinking that things well get worse, that I'll won't be able to find a job or training, that I'll waste those years learning nothing, that all I have learned is not enough, and what I'll learn won't be enough, that I'll be stuck in this state ... maybe forever.

There is still small hope, but hope sucks, all I want is to be able to go back to work. and I can't really do anything about it.                        </p>

                            2021-06-June-26-Saturday

Done nothing today, I spent it playing games, thinking about what work I could be doing, but not being able to actually work on anything, it's like I'm stuck but not really to be honest, I don't think stuck is the right word for it, it's more that I can't start at all really, I sort of get to "the starting point" and that's it, no progress get done at all, so I sort of abandoned the thing I wanted to do, cuz I couldn't get in the process of working on it, I did experience this before, was sort of a burnout.

I'm not sure, if I'm just turning useless, again, but that's how I see my self right now for not working for 7 days, but the thing is I can't get in there for some reason, it's like trying to physically push my self, I need to do that, no one else can do that for me, I don't know how to do it, but I'll have to figure that out, I'm getting into that stage where I start to think that I didn't make any progress at all, and it's not fun.

It's like I lack something, but I'm not sure what that thing could be .

I also feel a bit sad, I found out that my friend was online yesterday, it's just that I missed it, I was a bit late, probably 1 or 2 hours, tried to stay for longer hoping to seem them again but, they didn't get back, I'm trying to do that today.

I'm also trying to change my self around my friends, they said that I can't be "nice" for a whole day, so I'll actually do that for a whole "month", I might not be able to actually do that, but I'll try to the best of my ability, maybe I need to have more patience, or maybe I'm not humble enough, but I also need to be more firm I guess, I'm not sure how I'm going to do that, but I'll find a way.

Still couldn't get my self to do actual work out, all I can do for now is just one hour walks every other day.

Probably gonna take me long before I get to a state where I can build and maintain other habits, I'm still worried about the future, I'm not sure what to do about it, I'm loosing direction, I'm not sure where I'm heading, but there is only one way to find out, just move with what ever road I have, and I'll see where it takes me.

I also wrote a blog, I kind of what to upload it, but I think I should read it again, I'll try to actually read it again if I have the well power to do so.

Who knows, I could get something good from, or maybe something bad.

I don't know if I can keep on hoping for good things anymore, I don't think, I really care about a lot of things right now.                        </p>

Nothing was done today, other than minimal style changes, and now people won't see the color change animation when refreshing the page or going to another page.

I am unmotivated as hell, probably the fact that I failed in finding a job, makes me think and focus on that I'm a failure at everything, which probably is right, I'm still trying tho, I haven't given up yet, I really think that, it's just not in me to give up, I just can't.

And still can't find anything around me for a job or anything so, that is also not very good, but it is what it is, again this diary is the life of a loser in a some way.

Something I sort of did mention that about my self to my friend when I thought that I probably didn't get the job for sure.

They haven't replied yet, but that's what I said :

been thinking about the job thing for a while, dont know how to put it right, but it sort of enforces the though of " im just a loser " in my head, but at the same time, I'm at the point where i can't really care that much.

i would say i have been always "chasing" success, and only looked at my self as failure , but sort of never really gave up .
problem is i only looked at success as in financial way.

But it's the thing when you don't have money it's everything, but when you have it, then what.

Getting the job, or starving to death, wouldn't change the fact that I worked to improve my self and what I am now is better than what I was a year ago.

Now ... I'm sort of thinking of, making a podcast like thing, I wanna experiment with, but I'll have that based on blogs that I'll write, it would be just about things in my weird brain.                        </p>

                            2021-06-June-24-Thursday

Nothing have been done in terms of progress on the project, I'm kind of not getting in the work mind set, I also didn't get a call from the office, so I probably didn't get the job, kind of expected, it doesn't feel like big deal anymore, it's like normal to fail anything to be honest, happened a lot, at least I'm learning things, one way or another.

All I did was going out for a walk for 1 hour, I'll keep doing that for another week, then I'll try to start “jogging” or just sprinting. And see if I can increase my stamina, without destroying my feet.

Well, most my friend been a bit of assholes to me today, it's like I was under fire constantly, I'm not sure how to think about that, it also feels normal, like been there multiple times, I'm not even trying to play the victim, but it seems I'm like the person who get s the most amount of shit in the group that I'm in, its kinda fun most the time, I guess that's how it is, playing the joker/jester/group clown, but in someway, sad.

But for the most part it's enjoyable, I'm not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing, it just what it is for now.

I'm running out of options for training/internship/job, I don't find anything that I can actually do, kinda makes feels like I still don't have good enough skills to get things, done, kinda demotivating for me to even go back on my project, even though I would probably be finally done with it in 2-3 weeks, if I get to work, it's been almost 2 years now.

Funny that, few weeks ago, I was thinking that I haven't done any progress at all, but it's just a part of being too shitty to my self thing.

There is this weird thing that I also talked about yesterday, where I'm not really good, with people being kind to me, I'm really weird about it, but I sort of want more of it, I'm not sure how to even talk about that.

There is a blog idea that I want to write, and maybe make something sort of like a podcast, out of it, recently been thinking about my friend, really want to talk to them about what's on my mind, things seem like it's gonna get tougher in the near future, I'm not sure how or if I'll to handle it.

I'm just gonna hope from the best, good things well happen eventually, it's just a matter of time.

Just so that I don't forget what I want to talk/write about, it would have a title of “Finding purpose”.

But now I'm just setting here in the place where I used to talk to my friend at, and its just me and my thought of what I asked my friend “is this going to be the last time I talk to you”, they said that they would like to talk to me again soon, and I haven't seen them in 2 weeks now, and I'm starting to think that, it probably was, the last time I would see them, makes feel really sad, but I'm still a bit hopeful, the worst case, I'll still have my memory of them, it may have been short while, but a really valuable one.

I hope you're doing good my friend, until the next time, I'll end it on a HIGH NOTE.                        </p>

                        <p>
                            2021-06-June-23-Wednesday


Didn't do much today, I completed the styling for the (upload progress visualizing), and I played around with how my website is going to show uploads basically now they are being shown based on when they were last updated at, made sure that things don't get mixed up with animations.

But today was the day where I would know if the second company would take me for the internship or not, seems like they wouldn't, but I'll give it more time, basically I would know if they want to “hire” me if they gave me a call, and so far they didn't call me or anything, so I'm assuming I didn't get the job.

But it's been like 3 uneventful days, and I haven't worked on the project that much really, it's like my brain can't really work, or maybe I just can't get my self in the mind set of working on my project.

I'm sort of busy thinking about what the future holds for me, I'm getting older, I'm not a kid anymore, and I don't have any one way of getting income.

Sometimes I want to blame it on my parents as it feels like I was just brought up to fail, I wasn't really taught any skills that I could use outside of what I'm studying, I'm not that good at talking to people, and I'm pretty bad at finding jobs.

Part of me really wants to blame them, but the other part is also setting the blame on, and I actually don't disagree with both, I'm thinking that things might get bad, all it takes is one really bad day, and it would be the end for me at least.

I'm thinking that I'm really weak, recently I don't have much well power too, which sort of lowers my confidence, I made a lot of calls and almost all of them said that i sort of called late, as all the positions are currently busy, which gives me the feeling that I'm “late”, and I have a lot of “catching up” ahead, and sometimes it feels like I'm “too late” that its just sort of exhausting to think of.

It's like I was destined to fail, which, I don't know how to feel about it really, at some point, I just can't care really, it does sort of hurt me to look at my self as the "loser", but based on what exactly.

I mean yeah, to be totally honest, I still think that I am a loser, based on the past, didn't have many friends, people around used to abuse me and got away with it, I just couldn't defend my self in most situation, I don't recall that I ever won a fight, usually ends up with me getting beaten, fuk even in school, I was punished for defending my self sometimes, kids told lies about me to teaches and got me punished.

It's actually very bad that I'm not sure how to act around kindness most the time, I'm always expecting people to just be aggressive towards me most the time, and it's not like I want that, but when someone is being kind to me, it just makes me feel awkward, and not sure how to act, that I just tell them "I'm not used to hear that, I'm not sure how act around it, how about you stop doing that" , even though I say that, I still would like people to be a bit more kind towards me.

I don't know, does sort of sound like a loser to me, but it is what it's, what am I going to do about that, well, I mean now, I have a bit more friends, some of them do seem to care about me in some way, I have some skills that could get me a job somewhere, but still struggling. I have a project I work on.

I'm still not sure where I'm heading, it doesn't seem like I would go anywhere, i don't know if I'm even moving, I'm not sure where I would end up, all I know is that I'm trying with all I have to move somewhere .

Hope that I get somewhere comfortable at some point.                        </p>

                            2021-06-June-22-Tuesday

I only got like 3-4 hours of sleep, woke up early for the interview, arrived a bit early waited a bit, then I'm done everything wrong, I texted them didn't call, in the interview they told me that I'm speaking really loud, I really couldn't hear my self, they said that "we like your projects, but doesn't seem like your focusing on one thing", and I told them about the web site, they got a bit interested and decided that they wanted to see it, and i sort of "showed them around", and it was fine, until they got the “about me” page, and they saw this XD
</p><div class="images"><img src="./img/Screenshot_from_2021_06_22_20.png" alt=""></div> <p>

And then I heard a "Pff", like went from 100 to 0 and back in half a second, And I was thinking in my brain, well that may have destroyed my interview, the funny thing they asked me if I have any questions, and I was like:

what's the name of this company, I found 2 names for the same number.

they told me what the company name is, I really can't remember what it is, at that point i was like I already butchered it so why not fool around a bit.

I didn't even ask what kind of work I would do, or what times I would be working at, or if they're going to pay me for what I do, which as far as I know , they don't pay you for doing internship work sometimes.

which should be illegal, it's not like interns don't know anything or don't know how work is done, to be fair some of them don't, but still interns usually do the same kind of work that normal employees do.

But other than that, nothing much really happened I couldn't work on anything today too, was tired throughout the day, but kept on looking up hash tables hoping to get more understanding of how they work and maybe making one my self and use it, I'm sort of getting a bit unmotivated to do stuff, but things gonna be fine, I guess.

It's just a few days, I hope.

I may be able to sleep at night tonight.                        </p>

Yesterday I didn't do my diary, was kinda tired actually

Spent a lot of time talking to my friend after the interview
Which I thought was not bad, it was more of a testing interview than an employment interview.

They wanted to test me in data analysis stuff I believe, something I don't do at all actually, so i sort of failed.

They sort of wanted to see if cam use (dictionaries / hash tables), it's a way of string data and accessing it really fast, unfortunately I never work with it before, so I technically failed it.

But it's fine since I'm trying to get some experience, I'll try to learn about hash tables / dictionaries
and might even use them in my project.

I also didn't expect I would get the job anyways, which I didn't, today I got an email that I didn't get that job.
It's fine though, I can try somewhere else.

I still got another call from another office, this one is for training / internship position, seems like I might be able to do that one, but again who knows.
I didn't work at all those 2 days, I sort can't get into that mind set.

I need to finish the last functionality though, hopefully ill be able to finish it next 3-4 weeks.

Yesterday was fun, spent it with my friends on discord mostly talking, we played some games, and they started playing drinking games was really fun to watch, then another friend joined after everyone sort of left to sleep.

Haven seen them for a few months it feels, so we sorta talked for a while, catching up, and sort of having a great talk a bout life in general, what actually matters and what doesn't.

They wished me good luck with my interviews, and it was too late, so I sort of had to leave, still wanted to talk more but, I had to sleep.
I really enjoyed that conversation, and I hope you continue to do well, my friend.                        </p>

                    <h3>Sad and worried</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2021-06-June-19-Saturday

So I didn't do much today, other than trying to find out how I'm going to upload files to my website, I did find a utility that allows me to upload the files to my database, and retrieve them, but I didn't apply it yet, the problem is, I wanted a way for the user to know how much of their file has been uploaded, if it failed or not and the ability to cancel it, or restart the process.

I found that I have a lot of things to learn to make this happen, it might take me about 2-3 weeks to get that process done the way I want it but, it seems if I managed to implement it and understand it, I'll probably be capable of doing anything web dev related, and I would be actually able to say that I'm a full stack web developer, that understands what I'm doing.

Another skill to have, and it would also be the last thing for me to do in the project, and it would be done.

I'm almost there, I need to keep going, giving up now would be very bad.

Now for the sad part, tomorrow, I was supposed to meet my friend, the one I haven't seen in about 7 months, that I met like few days ago, they said they were going to be there tomorrow, and I can't be there unfortunately, I wasn't to be there I don't want to abandon them, I really want to talk to them.

My plan was to sleep early and wake up at like 3 am to meet them, but that's not gonna happen, tomorrow I'm having an interview, And it's already getting late, and I can't sleep really, I can't wake up in time, if stayed up I'm going to sacrifice my only chance at getting a job.

I really hope they don't hate me for this, I'm sorry my friend, things didn't go as I hoped, I wish to talk to you sometime soon, maybe things are going to be a bit tougher, and maybe we'll be able to meet again soon.

Hope to see you again, my friend, and I have faith that you won't hate me for being an idiot this time.

The interview is making me really nervous, and I sort of can stop thinking, what if I mess up, what if I get the job, but I can't actually live up to it.

A lot of (what if)s in my head, my other friend seem to have notice that this, they told me, that I am for sure more than qualified for it, and its just that my studies are in the way, and things are going to be even easier for me after university.
I said

I hope you're right

And for the most part their response is that they are sure of that I know what I'm doing, and they know that I'm good at it, it's my brain working against me, and that it's fine if I don't get this job.

I hope for the best, and I'll keep on going forward.                        </p>

I didn't do any work to day, I decided that I want to play some games, and probably do something else but all I did is just playing games, I'm thinking now maybe I should have started reading as a hobby, maybe I'll do that next time, or maybe just tomorrow, I really want to get into it, but sometimes it's hard to discipline myself when I'm bored, I'm getting a bit nervous about the interview, I don't know if I'll be able to do well, I'm also a bit worried about the future.

However, I got some good news, I finally got to see my results in my university exams, and I actually passed everything, including calculus, which I think I probably didn't make it, but the professor was "kind" to me, and decided to give me 50/100, and I'll take it, I actually still want to learn mathematics my self, and now I do have some sort of idea how to teach my self in a way, and actually I have a friend to help me with that a bit.

Also, what I find funny is that my average is 69, which I am immature enough to laugh at.

Soon I'll go back to learning physics a long with some mathematics, and see where I can use it in future projects, translation, and collision detection would be helpful in a physics engine, which is a project I want to work on, and I really want it to be fast and well-made , and I want to make it free for anyone to do what ever they want with it, let the people be creative, maybe they'll make something I like.

But taking that break makes me realize again that I did go far, from starting with almost no knowledge about websites to being able to build almost kind of website, provided I have enough time to do so, at least the front-end sidle of it, I still want to be able to find a way to link a paypal account of people want to have way to get donations from others, which I'm kinda greedy enough to think about it. XD

Hope I get to work on new stuff soon esh, and hope I get the job TBH I kinda need money, I sort of at the same time trying not to get my hopes up, and go for it just for some sort of experience on interview and such.

Welp, that's it for today, Nothing exiting.                        </p>

                            2021-06-June-17-Thursday

Nothing much happened today, was a bit boring, I slept yester day at 9 or 10 pm, and I woke up today at 10am, a bit of log sleep, but maybe that's because I got almost no sleep the day before.

Today I got the first shot of the vaccine, so that is new thing I guess, hope it doesn't kill me or something.

But I actually got a call from the same company I went to yesterday, they said they want me for an interview on sunday, which is a bit exiting, I guess maybe the Test doesn't matter that much, and they want people that have at least some idea of what they want, and then they well train new people for the job.

I tried to gather as much questions I might ask in the interview and also trying to get my self really do deal with what ever question they might throw at me, and I think I'm ready for anything, except for if they ask me how I'm going to handle collage and work, my most typical answer is I would do part-time, and take fewer hours in collage, means that well increase my time in the collage, but also means I would have more experience from working in the company.

I asked some people I know including my friend, they said that need to get have a good answer for at least most of their questions, which is understandable, my friend's reaction was : "if you weren't already studying you could easily get a job", which kind of amasses me, because I don't see that in my self, sometimes I wish I can "see" what they "see" about me.

And that's about it for the whole searching for work stuff, as for the project today I actually managed to make the users able to post things to the website, I made an object that can handle the data for the users, even non-users can have posts, under the name "anonymous" , cuz I want people to be able to post regardless if they have a user or not, for the personal website version I would let anonymous users be able to only do comments. as the whole website in that case would be mostly about one person.

Now I want to find a way to handle uploading images, and probably videos as well, I'm not sure how it's going to go, but there is an option of having those in a file, but then I don't want things to get mixed up in one big file that contains everything, so maybe there is a way to store them in the data base or something like, and I need a way to handle uploading itself, as and videos can take time to be uploaded, and if the users can't tell then if their files are ready, then they probably won't bother with uploading anything

But for now I have a way to link the uploads to who ever posted them in a way, using their unique object id, so that won't get mixed any other user ... or at least I hope it won't.

All I need to know to finish this project is how to handle files, and things are going to be great, and the project would be done.

Been an interesting journey learning how to make this thing, and it's probably time to stop doing working on it, at least for a while.

I'm exited for future projects.                        </p>

                    <h3>Weird experience</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                             2021-06-June-16-Wednesday

So today I went to what I thought it was an interview, but turned out to be a test.

A test that wanted me and several other people to write about ourself, test IQ, problem-solving skills, and programming skill.

But all on paper, which I suck at, I was probably a bit nervous, and I only got like 1-2 hours of sleep, I really don't remember if I slept it, so I had all that going, and when I went to the place, it was in a ... Weirdly empty place, although I think it's due to the pandemic, I didn't seen any workers there, I only saw the receptionist, who I think is the HR of that company, they looked like someone I wouldn't want to work for, or maybe with to be honest, I got there, and I said I have an interview here.

They said : no, it's a test today.
And I went into a room with 2 other people, doing the same test, so far there are a lot of bad signs to this company, they don't seem to be specific about what they're doing, they didn't have requirements in the job description, they called me and I sure they said "interview" on the phone, and I went there, and they said no it's test.

So I did the exam, and I was probably a bit nervous, and it was normal at the start until we got to the part where they where doing iq test, and I was like why would you do that, but at the same time I know why, but also I know there also all sorts of weird stuff around testing iq for people that you want to hire than junior software engineer, which according to some of my friends, and relative shouldn't be hard for me to land.

But by now my brain probably gave up, I can't really solve problems, and barely got through the iq part, struggled thorough the problem-solving test, and then got the programming test, and their test were actually from a website called.

geeksforgeeks.com, something like that, and actually most the problem I would be able to solve easily, but that was a test on paper, and I really suck at programming on paper, and I think I actually got all those questions wrong, my font was really bad tho, so I don't expect they would even understand what I wasn't trying to do.

I finished it and gave the paper back, it tokes me 30-40 min, got back to the receptionist, and asked is there no interview or anything, they said, there is going to be if we like your results.

when I came back I told my friend how it went, they said it was weird and sketchy.
And also sent them some questions I remember, and they immediately recognized it from that website.

But even if they don't call me, it was ok, cuz all I wanted is some sort of experience.

Hope that would help me in the future, I tried to work on my project, but I was very tired from not sleeping, so couldn't do anything really.

I'm going to sleep at night today, this didn't happen in probably a few weeks.                        </p>

                            2021-06-June-15-Tuesday

Today I spent most my time in bed, I was very tired , decided to sleep for a bit more ... end up sleeping till 3 pm.

disgusting/bad part of the day.
Wasted a lot of time , and lets say , that i didn't spend the first hour very well .

I'm not proud of it, but that whole masturbation problem was taking over ... and cuz I'm actually serious about solving this problem, I'm gonna keep talking about it till it's gone.

I mostly did it cuz I was bored this time, and I couldn't really get up to do work, couldn't really do much physically, was still feeling a bit of pain from the work I've done 2 days ago, and I guess first thing come to mind is ... easy to get, short term pleasure, probably cuz of boredom.

The interesting thing about is, it wasn't really a problem like 2 years ago, I was able to just not even think about doing this, till I got very bored, and I had nothing todo at all, was done with games, and had no one to talk to.
Now its like taken over or something.

good part of the day
Actually I got some interesting news, I got a phone call today at about 4:10 - 4:30pm, it was from a company telling me that they want me to attend an interview, and go through some test, for a software engineer position, I told them that I have actually applied for an internship/training position, but I still won't mind going attending the interview.

And then I started looking for the company, and tried to find things about them, it seems like they do a lot of stuff, The job description didn't include any specific technical knowledge, but just communication skills, team work, discipline, and passion for development.

Which I find a bit strange that they didn't have any technical skills specified, and i kind of didn't like the discipline part, that's usually a bad sign as far as heard.

So I toke those exiting news to my friends, that I got an interview, and I'm probably gonna do bad in it, cuz it's my first interview. But I'm going there for the experience more than any, and it's fine if I didn't get the job, at least I tried.

They actually do a lot of stuff, and it seems like there, seems like they do technically stuff for other companies that don't wanna bother with technical stuff.

And also told one of my friends in the same field , And he seemed a bit exited about it. And I mentioned some stuff about what I found about the company.

We end up talking about some technical stuff regarding the test and asked him about what test might be in terms of algorithms, and he was like

"I could help you with some questions, wanna do that over voice chat ?"

And I gladly agreed, to be honest, I do enjoy talking with them too, And having a conversation about technical stuff would be even more fun.

And he sort of tried to test me, with making an algorithm called fizzbuzz, was really easy one to be honest, and then we moved to something called a linked list, he told me just make a linked list your self, kind of testing if I can do constructors and objects.

Which I failed at first, cuz I decided to do that in a language that I haven't used in about a year, we struggled through some errors, and almost decided to let it go, I told them, that I don't want to waste their time, and I'll look up the problems my self and sort of try to refresh my memory of the language.

And once I'm done, I'll let them know.

They said they don't mind the talk, and they were happy to help even a little, it was actually very helpful.

About 40 minutes later I sent them the results, I managed to make it, and it works fine.

They said that I can just stop there for today, by that time it was already 10pm.

They told me that I'm selling my self short, as they know of people that don't seem to know what they're doing as much as I do, but still can manage to get jobs, And that I differently can land one.

Even if it wasn't this job that I'm currently applying for.

I really enjoyed the talk my friend, thank you, I really appreciate your belief in me, I hope that I could sort of repay your kindness.                        </p>

                            2021-06-June-14-Monday


Today I didn't work on anything, my mother had a lot of guests today, so I sort of decided the to stay in my room all day I was stuck in there most the time, didn't do work at all.

But I did a lot of phone calls today, I found a lot of phone numbers for companies, that might have a training position I can work at, it toke me about 2 hours I hope up late though, because my sleep schedule is not doing very well, but getting a job or something to do at a specific time would help me sort of regulate my sleep schedule.

Not a lot of success, well almost no success at all, most of the companies had those positions already taken, some of the phone numbers were not in use, or wrong, there was a company that actually closed by the time I got that phone, a lot of them don't have that position after the pandemic too, I kind of expected that, people were staying home and most the money wasn't going anywhere, some of it was gone, and a lot of companies toke a big hit financially.

But, it seems like I got one person's interest, hope that turns out well, and maybe get some experience from a training somewhere.

That couldn't have been done without the help of my cousin providing me with information on companies to call.

Which is all I need, I really don't want to be in a position I got because I know someone directly, at least I want to try and get it my self, some help is great, but learning the thing for my self is really important.

Meeting an old friend
So yesterday I was talking about that friend I haven't seen in like 6-7 moths, and after I finished that diary. 5 minutes later, I log on VR-chat, and the first thing I saw, was that friend asking for an invitation. I couldn't believe it, i sort of panicked trying to actually make sure that I'm not dreaming or something like that, cuz I was just thinking about them few minutes ago.

So I sent them an invitation, I was in the place ... or virtual place lets say, that we used to stay in, and talk, mostly because I was in there, and they joined me, once they were connected to my 'room', first thing I hear is, them sort of being surprised but not really, about the world choice, as soon as they joined, we started chatting, catching up on how both of us were doing, we spent like hours, it sort of went as if, it wasn't months, that we last saw each others, still they said that, I have changed, and asked me what happened, and i sort of told them the short version of my story, there were few moments of silence, and then, they said that, they did miss me, and they were sorry for the long time of silence, and they felt like they have done me wrong, and they do believe that even tho we know each other through this virtual world, they felt like this relationship we have is very real.

I told them that I understand that things maybe have gone in a way that made talking to them difficult in some way, I really wasn't mad at them, I was just ... sad that they left all of a sudden, but now that they came back, it's like ... it doesn't matter really, and that I was glad I got to see them again.

I almost cried there to be honest, this month is like really heavy on the emotions for me, I don't know why, I don't like emotions, well, I don't like the sad ones, but you can't have the good without the bad.

After that, we kept talking like normal, we did that for few hours till I had to leave, and then I decided to ask them, is this going to be the last time I see you ... they said that they want to see me again. And that they will try to be 'here' more.

I'm not sure if I did that, but I told them if they disappear again, I won't hate them for it, but I would be sad about it.

I said goodbye and logged off the game, hoping that I would seem them soon in the future.

I'm going to try to establish communication outside the game, so that it doesn't have to in there.

Hope I get them to join the place I'm usually, I don't want to be pushy about it, but I still want to maintain this relationship with that person.

I want to give them a link for this diary too. They were the main reason I got into writing my ideas.

And I sort of want to show them this one.

I'm glad I got to see you again, my friend, I hope to see you again.
I was really happy that night.                        </p>

Today I didn't work on my projects sadly, but I sort of moved things around in my room, chancing things so that my computer is actually in front of the window, and my bed is where my pc used to be at the other corner of the room, this is a picture of the room after I moved stuff.

This actually toke me the whole day, almost 10 hours, I was missing some equipment, I had to wait to some stuff, also did some wrong Measurements.
</p><div class="images"><img src="./img/IMG_20210614_014206.jpg" alt=""><img src="./img/IMG_20210614_014152.jpg" alt=""></div> <p>

I like how it looks, kinda feels like I have more space in the room somehow, but everything sort of hurts, I also clean the room while at it.

Plans for the next few weeks:

I need to make posts, blogs, comments, projects.
profile editing.
Gonna find some way to upload images, and probably videos in the future, And maybe some way to scale down images, with some user input, kinda like what we have in google/facebook/twitter. So that the user chose what part of the image they want to show, And also scale it down, to save on storage. And save all users uploads somewhere in text form, So that they can download it, in case they want to have it.

Make some admin tools stuff thing, have no idea how I'm gonna go about it, I don't know how much power I want to give for an "admin" if I'm going to have one.

Also work on the single user personal website thing. and host it for myself.

For the most part, things actually went well today, till I was done with working on the room, and decide to listen to a song, that reminded me of an old friend, unfortunately they went under the radar some time ago, about 6-7 months ago, and tried to reach for them, but all I got was silence, really miss right now, I like that song a lot tbh, but that bad side kinda makes me avoid listening to it.

They were almost the easiest for me to talk to, I'm getting memories of them, as I listen to that song, and I feel like I really need to talk to them.
the songs name : do i wanna know - arctic monkeys.

I don't think they would see this diary by any chance really, but if you do, hope that you're doing well, and we can talk again.
kind of a sad end for today.

I'll try to end it on a HIGH NOTE next time, :D.                        </p>

Most of what I did today was trying to make authentication work in my website, And I did succeed, now users can log in and log out of my website, they don't have to worry about login in every time they want to do something on the website, and now I'm going to work more on the users being able to inter data to the website, making posts, blogs, projects and even adding some bio into their profile, I'll try to also work on the ability to upload pictures.

I sort of failed to make authentication work the way I originally wanted, but it works nonetheless.

But for the most part things to be going fine, I'm doing progress, authentication was one of the hardest things I had to do so far, and getting over that step, makes me feel like I accomplished something, And pushes me to do more things.

I'm getting more excited to learn things other than website development after this project, of course I am still going to learn more web dev things, but it won't be the priority.

And all this makes me feel much better in terms of mental health, I hope things stay this way, at least for while.

I'm thinking about starting making videos again, there are still a lot of things to learn of course, and I'm going to keep on learning. And maybe learn how to teach people.

My project is getting better, it seems like it's going somewhere, today I didn't look for any job at all, I should do that tomorrow and see if I get something out of it.

There is more good stuff to come, I hope, I'm going to keep on working .                        </p>

                            2021-06-June-11-Friday

So I was lazy the past few days to write my diary but, I did spend most the time working on the project.

That's probably not a good idea, since my friends told me to take a break every now and then, so that I don't get and other burnout.

But the progress is actually going fine so far, I started re-working my back end, some of it is going to be based on an older one, but for the most part I'm re-writing it making sure it works the way intended.

I started by making a database and linking it to the project, for now I'm just testing adding data, and making sure it doesn't get duplicated, so far so good, now we can make new users, users are going to have a username and a user number ; so that they won't have to link an email to make a user on the website.

I want the email to optional for more anonymity for the users.

In that process I had to learn some things, a way to check text if it is valid to use as username , I don't want any usernames to have special characters like (! $ % @ ^% &amp; * ) , and I also don't want it to start with a number or a space or those characters (_ -), and to make sure I can do that, I had to learn Regular expression, its sort of an engine that looks for patterns in the text, it's really powerful, I don't totally understand it yet, but I was able to make a simple solution, however the solution I had only works with English characters, and I didn't like that, I want people to have the ability to have names in different languages, so I started looking up solutions from people with similar problem, and I found what I need.

I found someone's code, targeting the Unicode for every character from every language, I didn't know I could do that in the regular expression, so I learn something in the process, I modified it a bit so that it suits the way I want it to work with my website. And it works as intended.

I also added error messages for the user in case they enter something invalid or that the user would be duplicated.

Also, I'm not having much luck so far in looking for a job or an internship, seems like companies aren't takin anyone, that's really unfortunate, but it's only the beginning I just finished my last final exam for this semester, so I probably gonna have enough time to eventually find some company to work at and maybe get some experience.

But let's talk a bit more mental health, I don't think I'm exactly in a good spot, right now I'm doing actually fine, but that is normally what happens after a breakdown, the problem is maintaining it, I'm not sure if I can really, but I'll do my best, I'm feeling great that I'm doing progress.

But I need to make sure that I don't only work, and not do anything else, maybe some games would help, or maybe working out would be good thing to have there, I want to try and start reading books again.

But that might be too much at once, so I'll try not to over load my self with a lot of things at once, I'll try to add things one by one.

And hopefully that would be a good way to maintain my mental health, so that it doesn't feel like hell going through the day.                        </p>

Alright, so I'm trying to get back on track with the diary.

Unfortunately I didn't do any progress in the past 2 days in my project, been trying to step back, get some off.

But also been trying to find a job, or an internship. Not much luck yet, but I found one so far.

I ended up spending most of my day, playing games, and talking to friends, not the most productive, but it was sort of relaxing.

I still had some anxiety, or guilt, from not working on the thing for 2 days, tried to get something done, but for whatever reason, couldn't get anything done, sort of like my brain refused to work.

At some point I was looking at something files to delete to free some space on my hard drive, and I found a very early version of my project, decide to take a look.

And the deference was actually really massive, they hardly the same thing, for few minutes I did feel sort proud.

For like first time, in almost a year, it did look like actually improved my skills, it looked like the past year wasn't exactly just a waste of time.

And everyday it does seem to me that what my friends tell me about my self is actually true.

I'm probably really hard on my self, or I just don't give myself credit for the improvements and the work I've done.

Maybe I focus on "not having a job" part too much, and link that with "success". And that could be the wrong way to go about it.

So here is the picture of the old version of the website next to the current one.
</p><div class="images"><img src="./img/oldvsnew.png" alt=""></div> <p>
I spent some time just looking at this picture, and the more I look, the more I realize that I actually did improve my skills, and maybe my self, in the past year.
It's probably not all bad, as I think about it most of the time.

And maybe I need to be a bit easier on my self. And allow more room for failure, as it is what leads to success eventually ... I hope.

I ended up showing the picture to my friends, and thanked them for being there with me, in the hard times.

They did help me a lot, during the past few months, I don't think I can thank them enough for it.

Even tho mostly it was, just me and them talking.
And some people might say that, it's not much.
but for me, it was, priceless.

I have some faith, that the future could be better.
And so do I.

For the first time in, like, almost a year, it does feel like things can be improved, that things well get better, and it's probably going to be fine.

After finishing this diary, I had a weird emotional reaction to it, I started crying, I was also playing VR chat.

I was in a room alone, and someone joined, and tried to keep me company, I actually didn't know who that person is. it was some random person.
They were nice about it for the whole time, after about an hour of dealing with that, I thank them, and then I leave.

I still think now that I want to friend them.

Their name was ** I want to remember that name m I'm not gonna put it on the website but on a different offline note.

Unfortunately I lost their name when I lost my data a while again.

                             2021-06-June-07-Monday

So it's been like 20 days maybe.
Got busy with studying for exam, but not really, got really anxious, had a breakdown again, got back studying, and did most my exams, had a lot of things on my mind, didn't really write any of it, I'm not sure why, but things are getting better, or at least ... I hope it is.

The exam didn't go very well to be honest, It actually got canceled for the first time we attempted it, for some problems with internet connection, I only found out that I had to do the exam again, when it was the time for us to attend it, so I wasn't really prepared, I was actually a bit late, had to rush my answers, And I might fail that subject, I still have one more exam left, and I'll be done with this semester .

Trying to find training or an "internship" somewhere I started by asking a relative who work in the same field I'm studying, they said they might be able to find a place where I can get an "internship" , as long as I know how to work with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), which I can, they said that it would mostly take time to find something, and I totally understand, the pandemic is still is a bit of a problem.
I asked them if they want my CV, And they asked me to send it. And that is it so far.

As in today I finished polishing some things on my website, looks and works the way I want it to, and I'm happy about it, there is some work left to do in the front end, but for the most part, it's done, I can now move to the back-end without too much to worry about.

Now about what happened past few days :

I think I still wrote what was on my mind to some of my friends, and they where really nice about it, which I think I'm lucky for that, they tried to help me though it, it was really bad , I probably cried my self to sleep twice.

Felt even worst about my self after that for a bit, then had a confidence boost or something.

But I also started eating a bit more than usual, which is a sign of a bad mood, and probably means I'm getting into depression, if I wasn't there to begin with.
I used to do that in my teenage years, I used to eat a lot of things, cuz I was sad or angry.

This is what I wrote in the past days :

conversion 1 :
This conversation sort of happened between me and one of my friends, they usually replay after few days, cuz they are busy most of the time, I will take what I wrote probably word for word.

But I don't think it would be good if I did that to my friend

I'm a bit lost at this point, I don't know who do I tell that to.

It's like I'm losing my well to live, I'm not enjoying my games, work only the very basic stuff, and I can't study at all.

feels like i cant do it too, my brain is feeling a bit off, its almost like i feel some static layer around my brain, almost physically.

my exams are getting close i may have time but not forever, i know i have to study bit i cant get my self to study or work.

i don't feel joy that much any more, im sort of getting too emotional, im almost on the verge of crying 5 times a day for the past week.

im not sure wuts going on, and who to ask for guidance.

its almost like, not being able to taste food

im probably going through some changes in my personality , and suffering is sort of a thing about it , it cant happen without it .

i know i need to change , but change is still "painful" in some way its going to get me.
so maybe thats whats going on , the process of change is almost like burning my self , at least on the mental side of things .

unfortunately that might mean that im probably gonna fail calculus if i don't get my shit together in time

and its actually ok , hope i do change to something better .
i do think your right about me talking to my father about wut is actually going on .

hope things go well , i've always wanted to actually talk to him .
but its kind of a scary place to go to .

but not doing anything about it . is making the thing worse

what i noticed is that

everyone tells me i need to believe in my self way more, and that i don't give my self credit for my work

some also say that i do seek validation from others around me, and thats probably why im miserable

i do think its right

my problem is, i don't know how tp give my self credit, or be easier on myself

im realising that, i lack respect for my self

i remembered a time when i had a job, for like only 2 months, and a used to workout and draw as a hobby.
that point of my life is probably where i had the most respect for my self.

after that i sort of had to travel to study, i couldn't keep my hobbies cuz i was trying to familiarize mu self with the country, and a lot of things went wrong.

after that, i got back felt like a looser been like that since then

wasn't really a special person growing up, had shitty school life if im gonna be honest.

always felt like a looser, being short and fat sort of didn't help, and honestly i was a shitty kid.

but like the last 5-6 months before i traveled i felt like i can be something better, i was doing things mostly for fun

but i was improving, i got better at drawing, i was starting to learn about computers and electronics and programing, i was getting stronger and more fit physically.

when i came back from that country, i lost all of that.

and felt like i just cant improve really no matter what i do, im probably gonna stay a 'loser'.

but there is a part of me, still want to keep going, its just really tough sometimes

— 05/22/2021
They said that I need to take a break from working on my project, and I'm being too harsh on my self, and I probably need to do some things for entertaining my self, playing games or watching something I enjoy, wasn't doing much of that back then

They said, and kept saying, Things do get better eventually, I wanted to believe them, but it always seemed unlikely to happen.

Some of my personality has to do with it.

I did talk later about, things, that I want to do, when it seems like there is no enough time to learn it or do it, and they kept on saying, that I will have enough time, and there is no need to rush my self with learning a lot of stuff at the same time.

And I need to stop focusing on the mistakes that I make, and forgive my self for making them, just focus on the learning process.

I was getting more anxious about my exam, and we talked about it, they told me it won't be the end of the word if I failed. And I shouldn't give my self shit for it.

Seems like being focused on my negatives is something about me, I'm never enough for my self.

I accepted that eventually.

I tried to focus on the exam more, left the project for a while, till I was done with exam and got back .

conversion 2 :
It started by me ranting about something that was in my mind, some of it didn't make sense, but that's what I wrote :

Me
massive fuking rant

focusing on studying is still an issue.
there is good chance that im going to fail this subject, even though i do enjoy learning it.

still i say, learning is not studying.

i would say im just not afraid to fail but afraid to tell my parents that i failed.

or maybe its not fear its something else, more like sadness or shame.

cuz i have to go through this shit, cuz my father wants son to have a degree, idk maybe just to talk about it or something, or he thinks he still want to take decisions for me.

fuking already talking about getting a master's degree.

its like, he wants me to be the best, and i cant fuking be that, like cant i just be a fukin idiot.

so now im wasting my time trying to do things i hate, to achieve his goal or something , i don't know if he even give a shit anymore .

im only doing the minimum, which is not what he want, he keeps saying that i need to get that degree, makes me go mad.

costing him money, and costing me my time, while sort of making us hate each other in the process.

only thing holding me sane is some fukin hope that this piece of paper might make my life easier.

or that i might find a job sometime soon.

feels like it wouldn't happen, barely have enough skills for that, i don't know enough things to do it, makes my las few years feel like wasted time.

and i'll probably have hard time learning those things in a reasonable amount of time

all im thinking about is the progress of my project, i don't really enjoy my games that much, even though i usually enjoy learning and working, it sort of doesn't have the same impact those 2 weeks, i don't write my diary, my sleep is messed up and i cant fix it, i cant really make a schedule cuz that, and there is this fukin exam that i haven't attempted yet and it already feel like a fukin wall in the way.

ofc i have to act like everything is going fine, on the hope that i might pass.

all im doing all the time is probably complaining and being a fuking pessimist.

i have no idea what to do or expect.

all i ca do is work on that project hoping i finish it someday, but it feels like im gonna be stuck there for ever, making me think that im incapable of doing anything really.

and i cant fuking give up

and lets be honest im not a smart guy, i barely can do this project, already spent about 2 years on it thinking i would finish it in 3 to 4 months.
fukin barely understands what im doing,
fooling my self saying im gonna finish it this month
failing every fuking month, just a way to remind my self how useless i am.

talking shit saying im improving my work. when its all the same, just looks and nothing actually usable

What happened after that is, one of my friends, they where a bit drunk, they decided to talk to me, I guess to make if things were fine, spoiler alert, I was crying by that time.

They started by asking if was doing ok, And if I want to talk.

I said that they don't have to, and I said that I would be ok, soon.

They said they are ok with talking about those things, if I want, and they are just offering in a hope that it would help I guess.
They said that it won't be tough all the time and things well get better eventually.

I thanked them then I told them they are a good person, I thought it would be done here.

They said that

we can't really be always sure cuz we can't know what the future actually holds for us, but we can hope, and things actually do get better eventually .

that i don't have to worry too much about my exam , and failing is not the end of it .

i said its that its not failure that is stressing me , but the expectations , from parents specifically my father .

they said that parents do put high pressure on children though expectations , thinking that it pressuring them would always be a good move . or they might not even realize the pressure .

they said that im a nice person , and they hoped for me to get better , and again offered me to listen to whats on my mind that night .

i said that i don't want to bother people with my problems , been talking about it a a lot recently , and it , i don't want to be the always sad guy , i was trying to not be miserable around people .

i was like that a lot during that time , things were going down .

i didn't want to have people leaving cuz my mental state isn't at its best , so i sort of try to keep it quite , and not talk about things bothering me .

they said that people well leave eventually ,thats how things are .

I said that already knew this , but i didn't want to ruin what i have , i was trying to keep it .

i wasn't used to sort of getting attached to people , and the friends i made recently , i sort of did get somewhat attached to .

i said that i wasn't afraid that they would leave me , but i was afraid that im un-fixable . i believe there is something wrong with me but i don't know what that thing is .

they said there isn't anything wrong with me .

i said: why am i so miserable then

they started asking if i always felt that way .

answered : yes , and that i didn't know when it started .

they said that it could be biochemical imbalance in my body that causes this (which is a possibility)

or could be depression , and i probably should seek professional help

they said again , that there isn't anything wrong with me really , that there is hope , for what ever might be the problem there is a solution

i was afraid that me being depressed could be effecting people around me .

they told me that they had similar things going on , and they decided to talk to someone close to them about it , but they were also afraid to effect them negatively.

but they didn't get effected by it amd things where mostly fine , they learned that sharing those thoughts or feelings , would help with the problem being easier to deal with .

they said they were not effected negatively by me talking to them ,
but they also said that they hated seeing me miserable , believed that it won last for ever .

i said that i hate living in hope .

they said that im being too harsh on my self , and that i need a break .

i said im sorry that im always miserable .

at that time , i felt like had no energy left , i was actually crying through the whole conversation . and that i should probably sleep .

i thanked them again , and i went to sleep .

Thoughts i had :
— 06/02/2021
I'm still getting a bit anxious about ... my future and where, I'm heading feels like I'm still standing in the same spot, after those few years of trying to improve I guess.

What ever shitty breakdown I went through last few weeks kinda made me lose my habits, haven't even wrote my diary in about 15 days.
Every time this happens, it feels like, it doesn't matter how "far" I think I get, I'll still end-up at the place I started

That was most of what happened, the past few days.

I was talking to my friend as I'm typing this here, I was really sad, but I'm tired now. And I have to sleep.

Decided to say : I'm sorry that I'm always miserable, before I leave.

They said not to worry.

Hope things do get better soon.                        </p>

                    <h3>Static brain and fighting madness</h3>

                             2021-05-May-19-Wednesday

I couldn't do anything today really, well I actually did some fixes for my website's design, but that's about it.

I couldn't get in a mindset that is good enough to study anything, I was planing to see a friend to help me with some calculus stuff.

I'm not sure what it is that get me into that state, to be honest I'm always really afraid of talking about it to others, cuz it's always happening those bad thoughts about my self are always there, I'm thinking those negative thoughts I need to talk to someone about it, but I don't think I can really do that with people, cuz it makes it seem like I'm always there with “bad news” or just looking for attention, funny enough cuz I do think I need that attention, but I'm too scared to ask for it, thinking there is a good chance for me to lose that friendship that I have.

I do feel I need that attention, and people shouldn't really deal with, my problem is that I can't afford the "proffessional help".

And if I don't talk about it with my friends I might go mad, I can't let that happen, so I do, even tho I sometimes think it makes them avoid talking to me, but I still need to talk about it.

I'm not sure what to do about this.

I did talk to my friend, when they replied a bit late, but it is what it -probably we're busy with things, it's always good to assume that people are good, things are usually more complicated than what we think-.

But when we talk, they were saying that I'm still being too hard on my self, and I don't give my self enough rest from work, even tho sometimes I say I did nothing, and sometimes I don't do anything, but for the most part I do work a lot on my things for long times that I just don't notice how much time I spent on it, and when I realize that I did spend a lot of time, I still don't give my self credit for it, saying "its just simple things" , or "that shouldn't have taken me long time".

We talked a lot about how I work with things and why I'm upset about things like

my progress not going as planned
that I should be working on a different project
that I should be learning a different skill
that I still don't have a job and I don't have an income

They said, that just the skills I have now, and the project I'm working on it's more than good enough to have a job somewhere, and that the skills I would gain from working on my other project would probably make me able to work where ever I go.

They said it's not the end of everything if I failed the calculus class, I'm not planing to go easy on it though, I still want to pass.

But I always feel like I'm pressured to succeed, I told them it's cuz I don't have a job, and I'm living with my parents still, and it's actually my father who's paying for the university course (it's not nearly as expensive as it is in western countries, people don't take massive loans and spend almost the rest of their life paying it back, but still is expensive), and that I'm not close with my father and we don't know each other, and my father really don't know what I'm going through in terms of depression.

They told me that I should talk to my father about it, Since I think it's probably going to work if I actually do try to talk to him, and maybe actually fixing the relationship.

They said that I'm being too hard on my self and I need to relax things, and I'm doing way better than I'm giving my self credit, and sort of hope they are actually right.

They still think that my website is really good, they said it's awesome which like still blows my mind, cuz I see it and I say it's not good enough.

They told me that I should just keep on studying so that I pass my exams, and then keep working on my projects, and they are welling to help me if they can, or just give me some feed back.

They also said they have some interesting ideas that they are welling to like to discuss with me, when it comes to anonymous people on the website, I find that a bit exiting, cuz I like talking about those things.

And they would not mind talking about just projects stuff.

I would really like to, and I hope I'm not being too negative around my friends that I make them not want to talk to me.                        </p>

I'm pretty sure I'm experiencing some breakdown stuff, at least based on my last diary.

I'm really not sure what to do, I'm sort of thinking about giving in to the depression, I don't seem to be able to get my self out of it anyway, things are not going well, and I don't see my self fixing stuff any time soon, or even getting better I can't really work anymore, my project field and I need to start again.

I asked for help and the only answer I got is, that I need to look for resources that can help me with my problem, cuz I might need professional help.

I'm pretty sure I need to get at least some help, but I sort of know that we don't have that kind of help here, the only help available is expensive as hell and I know I can't afford it.

I'm so focused on my negatives that I don't see any positive about my self at all.

I'm starting to have some weird thing, I'm not sure what it's called, but during the day, I just start to cry out of no ware, I sort of try to keep things under control. And I calm my self down.

This never happened before, even tho I think I got things a bit under control, I still get that some days I get that multiple times.

I don't even know how to fix it, it's just me and my diary for now.

This could end in a good way or terrible way, only time well tell.                        </p>

The plan today was to actually practice and study some calculus, but ofc I didn't, I also haven't done my prayers in about 2 weeks, I'm wasting all the time I have I'm working on nothing.

I can't get my self to start doing any of those, I'm too tired to wake up, I have to attend lectures and even by the time all this is done I'm still tired as hell, I'm not sure what's the problem ... well, it's actually my sleep schedule, I can't fix it at all.

Anxiety session
So now I'm just sitting here thinking about all the time I wasted, I noticed that I spent all of it around a people that I liked to talk to, they even told me that they do like talking to me, but I'm soo fukin skeptical I don't know how to relax for some reason, they say actions speak louder than words, And their actions were for the most part saying what their words are saying.

But for the past few days I've noticed that a lot of people are taking the piss at me, don't get me wrong I do the same, but I'm not 5+ people.

See when a lot of people tell me that I'm just an asshole, they are probably right, when they tell me I'm racist they are probably right.

When they treat me as "a punching back/a joke", they are probably right, I'm not sure what I did to make people go against me constantly, but I'm pretty sure it's cuz I'm weak as person, probably on every scale, I can do (C/D) at best.

I'm not smart, I'm not good at talking or talking back to people, I'm not strong physically or mentally, I don't have much knowledge, other than computers I can't really do anything, I don't have a “skill”, I don't even have a good argument on anything, I lack experience almost in everything, I don't seem to add anything to any group I'm in, I can't really keep communications between me and people, fuk I'm not even a good cook for someone who really likes food, I'm ugly as hell, I don't even have a fukin job I can't pull my weight, and I'm failing in my university.

I've always thought that I have some sort of skill, at least when it came to talking to people I thought that the only skill I had was me being the casual joker, I sort of try to make people laugh at things that could be unconformable to talk about if said the wrong way.

But seems like, I'm not a joker I'm just A joke.
It's not that I don't want to be made fun of, but with the right amount of people and the right frequency, it does make me change my mind on things eventually.

I know I shouldn't care that much about how people interaction with me, but I guess it's cuz I'm in my 20s and still at that age, still gonna care about my reputation.

I'm trying to shift my focus from it, I don't know if I'll be able to do that, I'm pretty much a failure in everything.

To add insult to injury, none of the old communities that I used to be part ever really tried to “reach” to me, which is another conformation to how much of a joke I am.

Hopefully I'll get to study something tomorrow or work on something.

I'm not sure I have any well power left, but I'll try, nothing else to do.                        </p>

                    <h3>Learning things</h3>

                            2021-05-May-06-Thursday

So for the past few days I've been trying to learn calculus with not much of luck, seems like I didn't understand much, but I'll have to keep doing it anyway since I don't have much time to learn, as finals are getting closer and closer every day.

Been communicating with few people, and been thinking of stuff I could, I add to my website, a search bar could be useful, tags feature the ability to make groups and making projects work like blogs in away that users well be able to add more content later, and talk about updates, and show the progress, basically every project is going to have its page

Yesterday tho I didn't study at all, and I might not study today as well I know I'm running out of time, I can't start working or studying at all for some reason kinda like my brain is locked ... again

I'll try after I eat today and see if I can work or not.

So this is at the end of this day, I did something I'm not very proud of (masturbate), and I'm not sure how I'm gonna fight that cuz now it feels like an addiction, I'm not sure, but that could be me seeking short term pleasure, maybe cuz I'm ignoring something .

Thing is I usually view pornography , and the plan for now i do not do that ever again.

I'll try taking few deep breaths every time I get close to do that again

That usually works for most the time.

I don't know who might be reading this, but trust me, it is fukin embarrassing to say that for me.

But I also find it funny so don't feel bad for laughing at it XD

Someday people well be able to comment on that.

And I can only image me getting roasted XD, I'll actually stop reporting this everyday, and I'll probably do it once a month or once a week, so that it doesn't turn this diary as whole about me getting over this thing alone, cuz I have other things to get right.

Till next time.                        </p>

                            2021-05-May-03-Monday

So it was supposed to be just another boring day, I just didn't get to sleep, that was probably the only difference that was supposed to be there.

Actually my friend that offered to help me with, my sort of mental problems, They told me that they loved the projects page of my website, His feedback was mostly positive, which made me think maybe my project isn't that bad after all, or it has a potential to be good, and that, I can probably make something of value, maybe I was selling my self short.

Did some work on my website, attended my quiz and tried to stay awake as I only got 2-3 hours of sleep.

All up until I watched a video that quickly discusses the villain on an animated movie called "kong fu panda"

And yes I know it does sound silly might as well be silly as hell, the main villain was a “person” who was raised by his teacher who also played a rule as his father too who told him “you are destined to greatness”, the villain work his hardest his whole life to prove that he is great, and that he would be worth of the greatest kong fu fighter, he would reach that by obtaining the knowledge of a scroll, called the dragon scroll, his (teacher/father) believed in him, he taught him all he knows, cared for him, loved him as his son, and when the time came for his test, the dojo master told him that, that he (the villain) have some darkness in him.

His father was proud of him, yet he never really said that to him, he failed like he was unappreciated, at some point his failure makes drives him mad, and he attacks his father demanding him to say that he's proud of him, what led him to this point was the lack of criticism from his father, he always pushed forward to achieve greatness, meaning the scroll, which be come a physical representation of his father's pride in him. He felt like he has to have that scroll, as it was his only way to see his father being proud of him.

He was stopped once by the master, and imprisoned, but he escaped, and the master was no more, the only one who could stop him from destroying the dojo, would be the dragon worrier (the hero), before he fights the hero, he goes back to the dojo to fight his father, as they are fighting he demands that his father says that he is proud of him and his father does, he pauses for a second as if he came back to his sense, but it was already too late.

He finds out that the scroll is no longer there, and that's when the hero show's up

That's where I'll stop there

NGL at that point i was already crying.

Well, It's something that i sort of deal with, but from a different "angle".

For me, I always wanted to hear those words from my father "proud of you" or even my mother, but so far its like I didn't even come close to that, my experience was that i never really been a good enough but, but I was always told that I had potential, to be something much better than my self, I was already trying hard to get any of my parents to say they are proud of me, but never happened, they never really acted like there were too, I tried to do my best at school, which I gave it all I can really, up until the 7th grade, they never said anything to acknowledge that "you did your best and that's good enough", it was always "you could have done better" or even "you should do better" , and yes I probably should have done better, but I was already doing my best.

I still kept on trying to make them proud of me, but every time I look at them, I can see the disappointment in their eyes, the way they talk at me.
I was always reminded that I'm not good enough, by being compared to other kids from the family. and was told, compared to my older sisters, who never got punished for doing something bad, which made them arrogant, even they don't really realize it they are.

My father, never really spent any time with me really, outside of "I want you to work this thing with me", we never really talked I don't think we know each other, he taught me some stuff, made me feel like I wasn't worth the investment, and that made me feel like unworthy, and I still to this day feel like that.

Was always told I'll never be as good as them, and was always being punished for any mistake, always seemed like it was never acknowledged that I made some sort of improvement, and was still being told that I could do better, and I'm lazy, that's why I'm not doing good. Even tho I was doing my best.

No wonder why I got burnt out and had a breakdown, multiple times, I just basically learned that it really doesn't matter how good I think I am, cuz I'm not even close to good enough, and it doesn't matter if did my best cuz that wasn't enough work, and I'm being lazy.

Keep pushing my self to the point of breaking

I still don't think my parents are bad people, maybe they just couldn't care about me, I'm the middle child, so that's probably why, but I'm the eldest son.                        </p>

                    <h3>Confusion</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2021-05-May-01-Saturday

Again for the past few days I really did nothing, might check my website to see what I can add or remove from it, I'm still thinking about the chat feature.

And the tag feature, I also know that I want to make a group feature.

But that's for the future me, anyway.

Today I went to the VR-Chat party event that some of my friends do every week on Saturday .

here i sort of deal with a weird part of my self
I actually met the person that offered to talk about my problems there, it went very well at the start, but at some point, it felt like ... people are ignoring me, which I'm sort of used to, but not in a group of friends, or a group that I feel like I belong to.

Which made the "bitch" side of me start working, and I got anxious started thinking.
"Am I being ignored", I tried to say hi to someone, and they didn't respond it happened multiple times, I though that my game was buggy — which happens a lot — so I did everything that I know to counter the bug, went there to say hi, and it's like they didn't hear me.

Other people join, and they get a welcome, that made me feel, unwanted, I've texted one of them a lot recently and my text was too wordy, so I thought, it was just that, tried to talk to others ... and sort of same thing, so I am sort of setting down in the corner think about it (yes that's how anxious I can sometimes get, it's bad, I do my best to fight it).

Which made me feel unwanted on multiple levels, and that sort of ... made me think how many other people, don't want to talk to me, started to make me think about how much easier it was when I really had no one, and it was much easier cuz I didn't want to make friends and connections, and I started thinking -again- that maybe I should, be a totally antisocial person.

Sort if cut everyone, and only care about my self, but while being in the boundaries of a good person.

And I'm thinking, maybe I should, and the first thing to do, is to stop sharing what's on my mind with anyone, maybe only my IRL friends, cuz all that happened with my online friends.

I could be overthinking this too much cuz there was a lot of people around anyway and communicating was a bit hard, I'm just very anxious sometimes

Some of them know about this website meaning they can see this diary now, hope they don't think I hate them, cuz I don't, I don't hate anyone, and hope they don't get the wrong idea about what I think about them.

I'm not gonna blame that on anxiety or depression, it's just thoughts I have from time to time.

To give them credit, they came later and talked to me, I decided not to talk about my anxiety at that point, and act like everything is fine, I still appreciate them caring.

The person I was talking to recently what they thought of my website and other than the color scheme, they said it was really well done, and I'm probably selling my self short. Was really great to hear, and I'm greatly for that, I hope it is true, I'm still very anxious about my skills, even tho they improved a lot.

I'll act like everything is ok, and I know that some people can see through that, I'm still gonna refuse to actually talk, I'll do my best to do that this way.

This definitely means alto of breakdowns, but it's ok, I'll be fine. I'll be able to handle them.

And slowly stop being active, like maybe not be there tomorrow, but the day after join, then leave for more time.

Slowly taking my self out of everyone one's life.

On the bright side, I had one of my friends telling me that they do care about me, and that they used to leave chatting with other people, to chat with me, and they enjoyed spindling time with me.

That made me feel, like I made something of value I was really happy to hear that, and I'm probably going to just throw it away, makes me want to cry.
But, I'm starting to think, no coast is too high, for piece of mind.

It's ok, I'm probably really easy to replace anyway.

I'm not sure if it's something I've done, I really hope it's something wrong with me, cuz that is a much easier thing to deal with than, the “whole world” is wrong.

I'm still really grateful for every time anyone actually cared about my well being , it would be so wrong to just throw that out of the window.

I'm might not do that, but that's the second time I consider this, this year.                        </p>

Not much happened to day I did my assignment, we had a quiz too, decided that they won't count it.

Other than that, I didn't do anything, I'm thinking of adding the chat for my project.

Yeah, bored most of the day, spent yesterday studying, fixing my network.

And didn't get to have fun at all. So I was really bored.

Not sure what I'm going to do the next few days, but I know I have to study calculus 1.                        </p>

                    <h3>Panic</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                             2021-04-April-27-Tuesday

Haven't studied anything, I actually worked a little on the website for the past few days.

Things gone find expert for the missed up sleep schedule.

So what the panic is for.

Today and 2 days ago, I masturbated ... kinda more than I usually do, some people might not see it as a big issue, but it is for me, It is disgusting, hate my self for doing this, and I felt like worthless piece of shit.

I'm not sure why do I get sort of the urge to do it, even tho I hate the result, maybe I feel good for like few minutes, but it's not worth doing it. It's sort of like an addiction at this point.

I also did watch a lot of pornography, which I should have not done too, and I think that's why I'm failing the whole thing, so I need to make sure I don't watch that “content” ever again. That would be one of the first steps to sort of fix my life.

The first step I've been taking is, I was doing almost all my prayers every day (I'm a Muslim, and we have to do that 5 times a day), I'm starting to have it as a habit now so that's good too.

I can sort of maintain it.

I also was staying away from my working on the website of as much as I can, but not totally.

I'm not sure exactly what to do next, but I know I need to study for my finals.

I might start to workout like probably an hour a day, and have a walk an hour the other day, that might post my confidence, and probably would help me to stay away from my masturbation problem.

I can't believe that I'm actually sharing this online, but, at the same time, there is a part of me that really doesn't give a shit what people gonna think of me.                        </p>

Again it's sort mostly an uneventful day in terms of progress.

I was getting more and more Problems/Mental health/Anxiety throughout the day, but I tried to ignore it.

I thanked my friend for helping me with their advice, I said that I hope I wasn't troubling them with my questions ... they said it wasn't troubling Since they were the one offering help.

They also said they would be open to talk about other things, and they are happy to communicate, and NGL, I would really enjoy talking in general.

I'll try to work through my anxiety and talk to them more, I do like them, my problem is I'm kinda getting worst as conversions

Their advice was to focus on my studies, and I'll have time for the project latter.

No need to rush.

I'm looking forward to talk to them again.                        </p>

So now that I have at least some idea about what my "problem" might be.

It's time to figure out some solution.

First thing should probably be a schedule ; having a routine can be boring sometime, but the schedule doesn't have to be a torture to go though, having a schedule is important for staying motivated and not doing too much work, and paying attention for when I do too little work, it also needs to be somewhat flexible.
Removing a lot of my focus on the amount of progress, and focusing on doing the progress, without over working my self.
Stop comparing my work to other work; this well make working on my projects or even just working very hard, as I feel like I did nothing in so much time, or I'll look at my work as irrelevant.
Knowing when to stop to work on my project : this project has been taking all the time for the past year, and I still can work on it a bit more, but I should stop at some point, I can't work on it forever.
I need to stop being so critical about the flaws in my work, nothing is perfect, and punishing my self for every small mistake is counterproductive.
I might be doing better than I think.
I'm still dealing with some depression tho, and I'm not sure where to go from here, I'm not sure if anyone would discuss this with me.

I'm still feeling worthless most the time.

I have no clue how to solve these problems, usually I just sleep and hope for the best, but now I have sleep problems.

Hope things turn to a bit better situation.                        </p>

I'm not sure how many days it has been, probably 5

I haven't done any work or studying at all, and my finals are getting close.
I sent a message to that person, who offered to listen and help me with some advice.

It was worth the investment, they were nice, and they gave me good answers, and they were really supportive.

probably a possible friend.

They told me that I'm working long hours on my project, and that I'm getting a burnout cuz of it, they told me that i most likely doing better that I think I'm doing, and that no need to rush my learning.

They suspected that I might have a condition called "imposter syndrome"

They told me to focus on my study for now and not work my self totally out.

And that I would be more than fine with just the skills I currently have

During that time few things happened.
I sort of got another breakdown.

I talked to a friend of mine about how I would love to make that a better relationship with my family, but it doesn't seem like they are welling.

I explained my thoughts on why most my friends are usually older than me, and how I think the whole father figure thing.

They were older than me, they told me that they understand why I would seek a father figure.

But at some point none of my father or father figure would be able to give me advice to a situation.

So I shouldn't focus on it too much.
And maybe I should try to make a move and fix my relationship with my father.

At least I should try.

I thanked both these people for helping and listening.

I hope that I can return the favor someday

I also experienced something that happened to me for the first time.

Sleep paralysis, before I totally sleep.

Those usually happen after I wake up, this time it felt violent, I was hearing a loud sound, kinda like a loud banding on a wooden table, or something like the weird sound that keeps on replaying itself when a computer crashes.
Also felt pain in my head.

It was terrifying. I couldn't move, I couldn't talk or yell.
I was scared to sleep after it was done.

My sleep schedule completely ruined too.

I failed the whole "not jacking off" thing a few times, I'm still trying to put more days in between.

But I might just stop reporting that, I don't know yet, I don't really care about people reading this cuz it's mostly for me, I just right my problems and thoughts here just re make sure that I'm aware of them, and maybe solve them.

But ... enjoy laughing at it XD. kinda funny                        </p>

so I tried to do something today, I made icons for the website, but they were not good, so I canceled on them for now.

I designed the login and register pages. I didn't do any learning today at all, or practice on my math stuff.

It's been sort of a slow day, anxiety was always there, one of my friends said that I sound either soo tired, or depressed.

I'm hoping that I'm just tired, I don't think getting depressed now is manageable for me, I still have things I want to do.

But not to lie about it, I sort of didn't want to do things today rather than being tried or lazy.

I might try to talk to the person who offered to talk about it today, but I'm not sure how to start it, but I'll try one message kind of explaining what might I be like to talk to.

I don't know if I'm not good enough, or if I'm self destructive, Or if there is something I'm not aware of.

But I'll see what I can do, I might try to do some math practice, but that's highly unlikely.

I almost started crying about 2-3 times today, I'm being so emotional, and I don't like it.

I just don't know what to do, and I feel like I need something like a father figure in my life.

Even though I still live with my parents, I don't think I can really talk to my father at all about what problem I might be facing.

I'm sure he's not aware of what problem I might be having. And I kind of don't think he cares about anything other than me finding a job and taking care of my self.

So close, yet out of reach, I can't bring my self to talk to him really, throughout my life, I've seen the look on my father's face when he's looking at me, that look 90% of the time it seemed like it's saying to me

" your not good enough / you should be better / your just wasting time / you don't know what's best for you / your still naive / others are better than you / your probably the worst / you never improve ".

I don't know where to go with that, It didn't seem like he wanted to talk to me for real, I never got to know him, he never really tried. And I feel like I'm just there somehow. he doesn't know what to do about it anymore, I don't know what to do about it anymore.

I think that's probably why I tend to make friends with people that are older than me, at least sometimes they feel like someone I can talk to when I have a problem that I'm not sure how to deal with, Or something to at least complain about in a form a conversation from a human to another.

And that person is also older than me, they said they would help, but I don't know how to spot the problem.

And I don't want to rely on people, cuz usually I end up being disappointed, I'm easily forgivable.
I'm sort of "everyone's friend" but I don't really belong to any sort of group , cuz I'm the group clown.

it's the role that I chose to take, cuz that the type of person I am, the joker or the jester.

the jester in the kings court is usually perceived as a crazy person, but he's really not.
he just gets the giggles, when they see people taking things too seriously, I believe some may probably laughed at their king, and those probably were killed or ignored.

Since they are crazy.                        </p>

didn't work on my website at all

I tried to practice math and did bad, but it is expected, it's my first time in years.

I still have some more rime to practice but not a lot

I don't know if I'll be able to do the first beta of my website this week
there is so much to learn in so little time.

The same person from the past week offered to talk about things that bothers me.

I explained that I do talk to all, but in some cases I'm not sure how to start talking about it.

Cuz I'm really direct with what I'm trying to get from a conversation

they said the wont mind.

I might do that, but I should sort of warn them to what I am.

my anxiety levels are increasing

I'm sleeping really late, and it's not helping.

I'm not sure if I'll have enough energy to work or learn anything tomorrow

but i'll try                        </p>

So yeah, nothing really happened those 2 days, didn't do anything at all decided it's time for me to take a break from working too much on the project

I might go back to the design code and make sure it's well written, and east to read from a developer stand.

I talked to my online friends a bit, about things that do bother me, and some of them said they won't mind listening.

I'm not sure if I should talk about things that annoy me, but I know it helps with dealing with my anxiety and helps me understand my current situation and maybe find a solution, so I might do it.                        </p>

                             2021-04-April-14-Wednesday


For the last few days, I've been working on the design it's done for now, a few minor things are left, but other than a log-in and a register page, there is nothing left. Theme works fine, mobile view is also fine.

And work seem to be going well, I'm doing good progress, but it almost feels like it's still irrelevant, I'm ... not sure how to put it in words, but again, it doesn't matter how well I do, I'll still feel like it's nothing.

I keep on sort of ignoring the fact that I did progress, and thinking that I could've done more, or I didn't do enough work.

And it seems like I'm losing track of time.

One of my friends texted me, and I said it's been a while, but then he told be it's only been 5 days, and I actually checked, and he was right, for the whole time I thought it's been 2 weeks, and I only worked 5 days of those 2 weeks, but ... there wasn't really 2 weeks missing, I'm just losing track of time.

And I told that to someone, And they told me that I might be harsh on my self the way I look at this.

There is always the same ideas.

I don't have a job, I can't really do much work, I'm fat, I'm not looking for a job anymore, I've never been good at something, even now I don't feel like I'm good at anything, sometimes I feel like even my friends don't like me. I'm easy to forget, most likely easily replaceable.

It all hovers around being ... useless, not good enough, a failure.

And even tho I got 1 week of my anxiety levels going down, I still have anxiety, it's coming back and, it's not much different than before.

When I talk to an online friend, I told them this :
The conversation start here

Me
yeah now i just uploaded the last thing XD so im gonna stop for now i have to stop
been working on it for past 5 days
i thought the 5 days where 2 weeks XD
and was gettin anxious thinking i was wasting time .
i need to have some fun playin i guess for now
Me:
also glad you liked it :D

them
Why would you have been wasting time?

Me
hmmmm , the way i look at it is , i think that im useless all the time , kinda has to do with me not being able to find a job an such .
when im working , i dont feel like im useless so i spend as much time as possible , once i stop the " me useless " thing come back .
but i also keep on "puniching" my self for not improving fast or faster

them
I feel like you are being too hard on yourself

Me
maybe . . . i dont know
i feel like i should be something more , than what i am now

them
What I would do is try to allocate time ranges to work in. Like for example, saying you will allow yourself to work until 21:00, and after that you forbid yourself to work, and just enjoy the free time you have without feeling guilty for not working

Me
hmm , i try to do that but i end up just using my whole time to upgrade my project and such .
and doing research .
when i feel like i've done enough , i find no enough time for me to do something else
and i feel like " oh no im too slow at this "
i think i have a lot of things that im a bit insecure about , but its not things people mock me about , its things i mock my self about
its sort of self destructive i think

Conversation ends here.

And I think that all the time, that it doesn't matter at all, I'm still useless, no matter what I try, no matter how hard I try something, no matter how much I improve.

And now I'm thinking again about, maybe I'm just that.
The thing is, I sort of want to be good at something, I want to be good at what I do.

Maybe that's too much to desire, or the desire itself is too strong that it stops me from, truly living my present.

I try always to do as much work as possible, but I end up with what it feels or looks like nothing been achieved.
And when I think that it's time for me to stop working and maybe try to do something else, it's like not much time left in the day, do anything that I find fun, other than my work.

I do enjoy it, but, I always feel irrelevant. it kills my fire sometimes.

The feeling of being useless is sometimes overwhelming.
The strongest idea is that T don't have a job, and that is sort of A proof that I'm useless.                        </p>

                            2021-04-April-11-Sunday

So not much happened past 2 days

I was still kind of feeling a bite more anxious about not having a job, And not looking for one, And failing that one subject that I felt like I should have not failed, And I'm more and more drawn to go do work on my project, Since it helps me feel better about my self, sort of remove the feeling of being useless.

And I think the problem is that I feel useless to begin with, but to me, things do suggest that I am, I can't finish a project been working on for too much longer that I should have, I can't find a job, and I'm failing subjects in my course, so for my brain the thing I think about is, I must be a loser, useless that is of no good for anything.

And for whatever reason, I do believe in this idea.

However, working on my projects makes me feel like, I'm not so useless, I might be good at something, maybe I'm not so bad after all.

Till I stop doing the work on the project, then the idea of me being useless start's come back slowly, I noticed that when I was in VR-Chat, a game where you spend time talking to people in a virtual reality environment, I was spending time with my online friends there, it was a party, and even tho I'm not party person I live spending time with my friends.

And even tho I do love that, I started feeling upset about my self, thinking again, I'm wasting time, I should be working, I'm so useless. And soon.
I said goodbye to everything and went back trying to work, didn't do very much really, but I did something.

One person seem to notice that I'm upset, and they offered to listen to me, but I told them that, there is nothing to worry about, I'm not sure if I should really talk to them, cuz I might end up talking for too long, or just talking too much. And I didn't want to bother anyone that day.

One of my friends told me that they almost ended their live, few days ago, And ... it was interesting, they keep holding on whatever annoyed them, and they don't talk about it at all, thinking that they damage other people by doing that, but it only really damages them they do that, they only damage themselves, but they decided to talk to me and tell me about it, I tried to tell them, if they trust me, I'm welling to listen, and they won't have to worry about it, cuz my job as a friend is to be there for my friends when they need me.

They said, we'll see about that, and that they would think about it, I can only hope they do trust me enough, maybe I could help them.

I'm starting to also feel like I can't ever try to share that with anyone really, I try to do it anyway, it seems like I'm asking for help by doing that, but I'm not sure if I can find it.

There is something about me that, I focus so much on the negative, and dearly acknowledge the positive, like I told one of my friends, that I could never believe a compliment, but I immediately believe any criticism, or negative things said to me.

With all that aside, I've been contending on making the icons for the website, there is few left in my mind to do, and it'll be done.

The design of the website is 95% done, I need to figure out how I want The about page is going to look like in the end. I'm not sure of that yet.
But that's going to be done tomorrow ... which is the day I'm writing this at, I'm writing this for yesterday cuz I forgot to do that.

My sleep schedule is not at its best. But that's gonna be done soon, then I'm going to move to the back-end, and hopefully well be done soon.
And I'm kind of exited to test that.

I'd make a version of that project that is for the personal website. One where user should be able to download it and run 2 commands and that would host a website on the machine, it should run a database and a web app. It won't need too much data, so like even slow server can handle whatever, it would have only one user, without the ability to create new users, but one user with user name : admin and password : admin, and the ability to change that username, and the password.                        </p>

So today I woke up, and had both my exams, I failed the calculus.

Decided that I'm not failing subjects so decide to make a plan.

I'm going to be practicing mathematics during the next few months.

I'll try to make sure I'm not gonna actually fail any subjects.

I'm done with most exams for now, so I can focus on the project.

It's going to be done soon, eh, hopefully.

The plan is to make a tag system.

Make a text editor and text tags for links. Should probably at some property for code in the tags.

Italic and bold and underlined and stile.

All that needs to be added on top of the textarea element.

And people should be able to highlight text and click on it, and it would give them the tag.

I'll try to also add a short-cut to it and make sure it only types it on where the pointer is.

That's ideas for the future so, I'll see if I can do them, now I have to figure out how to upload images and videos.

I'll be going back to working on tomorrow. Hopefully things go well.

That was is for today                        </p>

Hello, I'm back again with this diary thing ... no promises, but I'll try to make it consistent again.

however, there was a bunch of stuff that happened.

I was extremely anxious and almost depressed, really unmotivated to do my work, but still tried to do it anyway.

And was also anxious about the future, if I'm doing progress. And that I would end with no friends anymore.

However, this changed, by the time wrote this. I haven't felt any anxiety in about 5 days.

This happened after I met my IRL friends
I texted them, told them that I was afraid that they don't see me as friend cuz we don't talk that much anymore, and explained my anxiety.

And their response was really positive.

It sort of made my days after better. I don't think I had any anxiety at all during those days.
I got a bit more energetic, and I was more motivated to do work, which helped me not be anxious about the future.

I'm close to finishing my website, I made and connected a database to it and the users able to actually log into the website.

What left is to do the functions to upload posts, and pictures with them, then probably I'm going to do a tag system.

And I have to think of some way to make usernames able to be repeated, without having to use email to make that user.

However, I'm going to make it so the email. Is a bit more consistent.

My online friends also helped me a lot too, I thanked them for their kindness.

I met some people from the same profession, So that is something that I also enjoyed, it did give me more motivation to have someone to talk to about something I enjoy doing.

And it did motivate me to work a bit more, even during the time I was anxious.

And after that I found a person who was had a lot of pent-up stress, they wanted to talk about it, and I thought to my self, this person is exactly in the same spot I was in the past few days ago, and I told them, they can talk, and I'll be welling to listen, some other people also joined us.

We all listen to that person, we did have somewhat of similar experience, they were having some problems where they put their efforts in people to help them, but they never seem to get that effort from people when they need it.

They were emotional about having people around actually listening, which is understandable at least from my end, they seem to never experienced people caring about their well-being.

And I thought I could try to help that person, thought it would be ill thing to leave someone in the same situation I was in thinking that it's their fault, and probably helping people is a way to sort of give up to people.

They seem like a nice person and I would love to talk to them again.

I also did an online test about personality.
Turns out I have the architect (engineer) type of personality it was interesting to go through it, I tried my best to give the most honest answers, hopefully I got them right.

That was most of what happened most of the past-time ...

Again I'll try to be more consistent with the diary again, it could be a good thing to keep up. Hopefully it leads to desired results.

Today didn't work on my website, because I was sort of studying all day, I have 2 exams tomorrow.after that i won't have exams for while.

Hopefully I fix my sleep and go make a good schedule.

That's it for now.                        </p>

I don't really remember what I wrote last time, I didn't check it.

In the past 10 days I was dealing with extremely negative view on the world, I don't know why.

I thought I was living in hell or something, was constantly thinking about. How worthless I am, that no one is actually my friend, and I'm losing the ones I still think I have.

That no one would really care about me at all, I'm just a sort of tool for people to talk to, not really caring about my well-being, while I'm kind of trying to be good to people in one way or another, I though that I was totally, worthless and I that I probably deserve it anyway.

If we imagined that the whole world is actually against Me, it would be less likely to me that I'm on the right, I mean I can't say that ALL is wrong, right ?

If people don't like me there is something wrong with me right ?, who else to plume ? Parents ? Siblings ? Classmates ? School ?

Should I really just plume everywhere thing and say "no, it's not my fault".

That seems like stupid to me, but I'm also trying my best to be a good person to others. I try to listen to them, I try to make them feel welcomed, I try to make them feel trusted.

Why when I do all this, I end up feeling like exactly the opposite.

What do I really want, Why am I constantly thinking that people hate me, or don't like me, or don't want to talk to me.

I don't know

I still tried to write something in those days somewhere else, and I have what I wrote I'm gonna leave it here

— 03/16/2021
not sure what's happening
It's not that I feel extremely sad.
But I just don't enjoy playing a game CUZ if try to play my brain shuts down, if I try to work my brain shuts down, if I'm trying to learn new something and implement it my brain shuts down.

— 03/22/2021
Well I can't sleep ... haven't done my diary in about a week now
It's time to another one of those

So ... I'll be honest, a big part of me hates who I am now, mostly things that I can never be anything more a failure.
I constantly afraid of being a bad impact on people around me, that's probably why I keep making jokes all the time, it's way better to laugh.

But then me being Me I think that talking shit about my self is ... funny, at least I won't hurt anyone this way. And since I don't really care about my self then I wouldn't matter.

The more I do this, the less respect I have towards my self, and the less people would respect me.

And I'll be able to notice that.
that results in me hating my self more.

I do think I can end the cycle tho
I think I'm already going down hill.
probably would never be able to fix this.

my only plan is to isolate my self.
probably focus on things that are more important, like find a job, actually finish your project, try to better my self.

but it seems like I no longer have the well power to do any of that.

Usually I think ... I'm just a waste of space, not really good at anything. Doesn't have the well to be better. Never been usefully, maybe the only thing I can do is be the clown ... nope also bad at it.

Clearly notice that I'm more of an annoying person. And it's getting worse every day.

Ending it doesn't sound like a bad idea really.

its so weird its like i lose the ability to do things when i try to do the

So I'm doing one of those again

Plan was to sleep early, couldn't.
So decided open VR-chat, was in the world, where I used to spend time with my old friends.
Kinda indicates that I'm still holding to that past.

It made me a bit more sad than I was XD. started talking to my self ... was mostly about the weird double standard where I kinda don't really 'want' friend but at the same time I do want to make friends.

How that I need to let go of the past.
The fact that I probably need help since I'm starting to think about ending it, and that is bad sign.

The fact that I kinda hate my self.

Till someone joined and decided to talk. And I decided to add them.

We talked for a while, then joined a friend haven't seen in a long time.
Spent the rest of the time talking about random stuff, joking ... etc.
Other newer friends joined, and we talked for a bit.

and actually felt much better.

03/23/2021
I should just go back to writing my diary.
Actually had a day without being negative about anything.
Its actually nice, I need more of this XD
I being productive again.
I hope that would be the end of my depressed phase XD
All I need is ... to just talk about it, I guess

But I can only think how long it would take me before I think about ending it again

negativity is not all what happened tho

So today and yesterday were actually fine days. I didn't feel anxiety.
I wasn't depressed. I was even motivated and made 2 videos, that I'm still editing, I finished one of them.
And I got back to working on my website again. I'm going to actually finish it before I start the 2D Physics engine.

I want to have an actually working website thing, and make one version where only I can post in it, sort of personal website.

People can only leave comments and such.

But that's on the making now, hope it does go write.

I'll be doing my best.

I'm still failing the not masturbating thingy. I'm trying but also eh.

I was watching pornography when I was doing it, so I think if I stop watching it the rate would go down eventually leading to me stopping.

That's the plan now.

I mean, it's just a waste of time usually when I do it, I would be just trying to sleep. And just do what has to be done, XD.

But that was all I can remember for the past days I'll try to keep it for the best of my ability.                        </p>

It's been about 6 days now, I haven't done anything production maybe only uploaded one video, project is still not online.
It's nowhere near done, I'm very late, so I just can't pic things up and work on it.

Been trying for the past 3 days, but I can't work on anything, seems like I'm stuck, or maybe something is wrong with me, or maybe something that happened, or maybe something from the past, or anxiety about the future.
SOMETHING, I don't know, I don't seem to be able to help my self out of it.

As per usual, I don't know when is this going to stop.

I don't like working anymore, I totally fucked my sleep schedule, I don't go out for my walk, I don't even enjoy games now, I don't want to play games, actually more like I just can't play them, and I just can't work on my projects or anything.

Been kinda writing my thoughts outside this diary, but here's what I did write.

{
— 03/09/2021
I'm getting anxious again
haven't written my diary today

Starting to think that I might be an annoying or bad or just too negative, and probably my friend's didn't contact me cuz of that, maybe they don't see me as a friend anymore.

I think I'm losing the "well", to do stuff. My skills are not improving, and I'm just wasting my time, doing things I'm not enjoying.

Also starting to think that i might be effecting people "negatively" when i talk about my problems.
should probably keep to my self

— 03/12/2021
So ... I guess I'm kind of afraid that my IRL friends, don't really think of me as a friend anymore, or maybe don't care. Usually I say they're probably busy, they have something to do.

Some of them haven't seen in more than a year.
And none of them really starts the conversation most of the time it's me who try to keep communication going, but haven't done that in long time that I feel it's probably too late.

All of them expanded their social circle. I didn't, well I mean if you want to count people I know online then, I kinda did, and now it feels like I'm losing my friends :D.

i need to learn how to be anti social again , probably for the best .

Welp, that was something on my mind today for some reason decided to let other people deal with my shit so there you go XD

— 03/14/2021
Haven't, done my diary in 3 days I guess probably even more, I'm just unmotivated to, work on my stuff, I'm not sure why I'll try to sort of "force my self" to get to working on my projects, usually i everything go like normal, If I get through the first 5 minutes of working something, cuz then I do enjoy working on it. I'll try to do that when I wake up.

Not sure, If I'm actually fucked up already, or that I'm having hard time to let go of some things from the past, it's probably a bit of both.

Seems like it's going to be few shitty days for me, but I'll try to go back to work as if everything normal. I'll act as everything is ok. cuz ... yes, there is nothing better to do really XD

}

I'm bored all the time, nothing seem to really entertain, when I try to work, my brain shuts off, I'm not sure what is that about TBH, I don't really try to play games, cuz I somehow don't know what to do with them anymore.
I try to learn something but when I try to implement it, again my brain totally shuts off.
don't really enjoy food, kinda stopped seeking it. Unless I really have to.
all i want to do all the time is sleep .

Why is this happening, I can't find an answer, I need help.
I can't afford it, probably don't deserve it.
I don't want to end my life.
but maybe I should.
Things are slowly becoming ... tasteless for me.

nothing
Everything that I enjoy, games, programming, working on my project, watching videos, soon I'll probably stop enjoying talking to my friends.
who knows whats there down the line for me .                        </p>

                            2021-03-March-09-Tuesday

So for the past three days I only did one video.
I dearly was able to hold to my schedule. I'm not motivated enough to work on my projects but at least I was able to make the video so, I guess, it's not entirely bad.

But I've been feeling really bad, it was hard to get any work done, today I didn't do anything at all.

I'm not sure what's the problem with me, I think it's too late for me to help my self now, cuz it's at the point where I believe I need help, and I probably a therapist, and there is no way for me to afford it.

I'm not sure what to do, we're talking to my friends and cuz I forgot about writing my.

So that what I wrote in the past few days.

— 03/06/2021

Hmmm I'm noticing a problem
Where when everything seems to be going well
I just become aware of or remember a problem that I'm dealing with.
And that's when I start having anxiety and my productivity drops again
I start judging my progress, usually ends up in thinking that. It's not good enough.

— 03/07/2021
I'm gettin anxious again
haven't written my diary today

Starting to think that I might be an annoying or bad or just too negative, and probably my friends didn't contact me cuz of that, maybe they don't see me as a friend anymore.

I think I'm losing the "well" to do stuff. My skills are not improving, and I'm just wasting my time, doing things I'm not enjoying.

Also starting to think that I might be effecting people “negatively” when I talk about my problems.
Should probably keep to my self.

I wish could find a way to help my self, but it is funny that.
today I technically helped a friend with something similar.
They said they were trying to learn an instrument again, they used to play it 10 years, and that they said that they are not being motivated while doing it. And it's kinda similar to my problem.

They are thinking all the time that they should be doing better, they need to be better, and they are so focused on not making nay mistakes, and sort of punish their self for making them, so I told them, well maybe you're forgetting the point of it, it's about having fun not being the best at it, It's something I learned from listening to lectures form a "guru" by the name "Allan watts", they pointed something that I think me and my friend where ignoring.

They said : "whats the point of playing music, or dancing, you don't try to finish the music as fast as possible when your playing music, and when you're dancing you're not aiming to end up in a specific point in a room or something, the whole point of playing music, is to play music, and whole point of dancing is dancing."

And I told them, why did you start doing it in the first place, and they said I did it because it was fun, I didn't care if I was good.

So I told them that, this is how they should do it now, just play music and have fun. don't worry about being good, you'll eventually get there if you just keep doing it for fun, you won't notice it but eventually your skill will improve, but the whole point is to do it because you enjoy it.

And that was funny that it's coming from me, sense that was exactly the advice I need to follow.

I was just keeping on thinking that I need to improve my skill, but I forgot that the whole reason of me doing my project is just to do them, because I wanted to do them.
So I'll try not be harsh on my self and focus on actually just doing what enjoy doing, hopefully that goes well. Maybe that is going to help me.

I should thank my friend actually for that, probably been in The worst situation. If I didn't talk to them.

So that was it for the past three days, and also I didn't survive the (no nut challenge) XD. I'll keep reporting that until some point I guess.

I don't even find it embarrassing to admit it. But it's a problem that I need to solve. I'm still trying.                        </p>

                            2021-03-March-06-Saturday

Nothing much happened today, I was kinda looking forward to talk to some of my friend, unfortunately I didn't get to do that.

Prepared for a video for to make tomorrow, I think I should use obs only for video recording, and audacity for audio.

Also listened to some "therapy session" a video about some person called Dr.k, they usually interview people that are popular online.

And he tries to talk to them about issues that they might be facing more of a “spiritual” problems.

And they are talking of this person who said, that they were dealing with a problem where they, enjoy working on something more than playing anything, or talking to friends.
Because they had friends before, and they lift them at some point, but their work feels like it's going to be there for them when ever they need it, Whereas their friends might not be there.

They also said that they enjoy work because it makes improve, it makes them think they're done something, that they are good at something, and they broke it down to dealing with a problem as a child, where whey were punched for not being “good enough”, being punched for trying to stand up for themselves at some point.
They devolved a trust issues, out of this, they didn't really have many friends or even a social circle when they were growing up.

They got punished by their teacher at some point, which made the other children abuse them at some point.
They moved somewhere else, which stopped it.
But they felt the same when they were doing work, from someone on who is their manager, for example.

Growing up they were told, that they are not good enough, they are not smart enough, they should do better.
Ever though, they are doing their best.

They still only made one friend at a time, tho.

All these, except never having the social circle, I'm very familiar with.

But for a long time I only had one friend for half of my childhood, didn't have a social circle really until I was about 14 years old

This caused them as well as me to judge their self for not being better .

And the answer for that situation.
To judge them self this way.

They also talk about blaming them self almost everything, also fulling the fire for telling them self that they are not "good enough", even if it is not.

They also have that problem of that they get emotional sometimes, and it makes them feel weird, and tell themselves that they shouldn't cry for example, they shouldn't feel sad, they shouldn't, show “bad” emotions.

And the answer for that is that, they had to accept them self having these moments, and accept that having these weird moments about showing emotions is totally ok.

All of this make them really enjoy work because it feels like it's a safe place, because it makes them feel good about them self, and it makes them feel like they are good.
so they end up being "addicted" to work, spending too much time working and very little time spending it with friends or families.

And even tho I'm still struggling to actually keep on learning stuff working out and doing "productive things" I'm slowly putting more and more time into work, I'm spending less and less time trying to talk to people really, unless it won't affect my production at all, I still play games.

My unproductive time is more than my productive time, but it's slowly starting to be the other way around.

I do enjoy doing productive work more and more, probably even more than playing games now.

But they were told that they should try to make more than just one friend so that when things fall down with one friend you still would have the others.

Maybe I should get more friends or ... just stay away, on my own, and just don't worry about having or losing my friends.

The fear of loss is big, I'm not sure if I can overcome it, and the way I look at it is if I don't have anything to lose. I wouldn't feel as sad ... right. but this also means I have nothing.

It's a hard thing to choose.

Maybe someday I'll find and answer.                        </p>

Nothing at all happened today.

I ate too much
I didn't work out since I decided that Fridays are going to be my “day off” of the week from work and learning

I kinda planned to learn something today, but I didn't.

I'm starting to get a bit anxious, since I saw one of my “old friends” appearing online again. But still never communicated back.

But I'll try to forget about the past.
maybe sometime soon I'll totally get over it.

But that's it for today                        </p>

                    <h3>Schedule optimization</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2021-03-March-03-Wednesday

Today I edited the video I'm going to upload it tomorrow. And now I'm thinking about changing a bit in my schedule so that one day for recording one day for editing and the third day for uploading, so that I only upload twice a week .

Today I did workout again and went for a walk, but I'm thinking maybe I should make it so that I walk one day and workout the other and I can have Fridays or Saturdays off.

The reason I'm doing this is because now university is taking a lot of my day, and it's going to take even more time once I start getting assignments, I'll have to do them, maybe I can do them during my day off, but that would probably beat the idea of a day off, but i won't have uni during Fridays and Saturdays, so I can do them in one of those days maybe, and also because I can't find time to learn C, so I need to move some things around in the schedule.
I'm also trying to eat less while keeping on walking and working out.

Hopefully that works in me losing weight or maybe gaining some muscles, cuz I'm like weak AF now, and I don't like it at all.

I'm having a problem where if I run or walk too much, my foot's skin would tear apart, and it's really painful, I'm not sure how to solve this problem tho, I'll see what I can do about it.

So when I was walking today, I was a person who is taller than me, and I tried to walk faster than them, but I just couldn't, and I started thinking maybe I'm just in a massive dis advantage cuz I'm short, I was thinking it doesn't really look like I have any advantage, taller people would be stronger and faster than me, I probably wouldn't even be smarter, which all is kinda of depressing for me cuz it makes me think I that I have so little value as a human I guess, but it was starting to make me depressed about it and thought “why would that matter to me ? am I competing ? not really, why would I be competing in the first place for what, I hold only compete with my self, only try to be better that who I was yesterday not other people, try to improve on my self”, but i also though thought that, the only advantage would be that, my body doesn't require as much food, and that I would probably live longer, that is if no other taller people kill me of course XD.

But also I accepted that, That's how I am, and I shouldn't be upset about it, it's not something I can change, I can lose weight, I can gain muscles, I can't get taller, and that's fine.
Being shorter doesn't make me a loser, it just means t hat I might be in a disadvantage physically in some situations, can't get 'em all, and it should always be that way.

I still do think that I am living the life of a loser tho, I probably heard that enough for it to stick in my head now, but also it doesn't seem like I'm achieving anything, I'm still trying to work towards it, maybe someday I'll get there.
but for now I am a loser.

Oh, and I also failed the whole "don't yank it for a while" thing, seems like those day gaps are starting to close, I'll try to put more days in that gap.                        </p>

                            2021-03-March-02-Tuesday

So yesterday I came back from my walk, and I wasn't feeling very well so, I ate food, and actually today at the time of writing this, I already ate food.

I'm doing this makes me not believe in my self at all but I guess I'll be able to somehow get to water fasting it's much better option for me to lose weigh, or I could work out.
Water fasting may lead me to lose what ever muscle I still have, working out might be a better option since I don't like to be a weak person, but i the goal is the same I want to lose enough weight that I won't be fat anymore.
so I'll keep on trying.

I also re-recorded the video and going to edit it today and upload it to YouTube and LBY, I'm also thinking of making a Bit chute account.

I'm thinking of maybe working out today sometime before I go for my walk.

So maybe I'll do that, I'll try to keep working towards that goal of loosing a lot of weight in the next 2 months.

Problem is, I'm always seated when I'm working on my projects or learning something.
Also, I have to learn something today.
So I'll try to learn how to make some graphics appear on window in the next week that's the goal for C programming. I'm still learning the basics so, a window is still a bit too much to do as the first thing. I wanna learn how to deal with data and data oriented programming.

Hopefully I do learn something

So I'll see what I can learn today

So I also realized something yesterday, I saw one of my IRL friends, and I wasn't really able to talk to them, but I decided I can call them and ask how they're doing, it went like any usual conversation he said that they're doing fine, even tho they're not, I said that I'm doing fine even tho I'm not really, asked what he was doing, and i he said that he was waiting for a friend.
And we ended the call there, and I was doing my walk thing, so I couldn't keep talking to him and got distracted till the end of the walk.

When the idea got to my mind, that one of the reasons I had anxiety is probably due to all of my friends expanding their "social circle thingy" — I'm not sure what to call it —, and the more I think about the idea of having friends seems to not really matter that much anymore, I would think I probably can completely do without it, maybe at some point I'll just actually give it all up and live without any social interaction, or basically the minimal amount possible.

It's just a thought I'm not planing to leave everyone anytime soon, but at least, it's kind of a relief that now I know why I was anxious about friends, does it make me a stupid person that it toke me years to realize that, or maybe I wasn't really focusing or paying attention to it.

Couldn't find time for me to learn C today, I'm still trying to develop an efficient schedule.

that's it for today, hopefully tomorrow is better I guess.                        </p>

I've been trying to set up my pc again to work fine with what I'm trying to do.

I started preparing material for my video creation.

I'll make the first video today, I also enrolled in university.

I hope it's a good decision, but I won't know until way latter down the line.

I failed the whole not yanking it thing again, I'm still gonna keep on trying not to.
and I also started water fasting.

And I have a plan for the next few months maybe, which is every day I have to

upload a video or prepare for one.
Learn something in C programming language,
Do a one-hour walk
And hopefully in one month I'll probably lose some of my weight
I'll be done with the project, and I'll learn something in C and would have started doing something in my next project

Also, I'll be writing here how many days left before I get to eat
3 days left

Alright so I already did record for a video and when I started editing it, I noticed that it's low quality, so I'm gonna have to re record that again tomorrow hopefully things go well, I did change the settings.

I can't get my self to learn something today

My head really hurts I don't exactly know why, but probably cuz I started water fasting, I still won't give up on it yet, Hopefully I can keep going for a month, I really want to eat something.
But I have to keep on trying, I know that it's just the first few days that are hard, but I'll stop if I have to.

I'm going to do my one-hour walk a day thing, and if I feel so bad I'll go back and eat one meal, and probably keep it to be one meal a day with all the rest                        </p>

                            2021-02-February-23-Tuesday

Been failing for the past few days to do my work and keep a routine going
it's pretty hard for Me, I guess, I'm having problems to focus sometimes, I fixed my sleep schedule problem and failed a bunch of stuff, like not yankin it for a month XD, It shouldn't be hard for me, I just got bored again.

A month should pass, I'll keep trying my best, I'm putting more days in between I believe.

However, I wasn't working on anything too, I'm not sure why, but I'm feeling too tired and cold all the time, I'm not sure if that's a big enough issue for me to go to the doctor for it, but if it keeps on going that's probably why, maybe It's because I don't do exercise at all, I don't move that much anymore, and I know I should, I'm planing to be in shape buy the end of this year, it does sound like new year resolution Bullshit, but I'll try to make it real.

The plan is to water fast for 2 months. I'll see how that goes, I'm going to start at the start of the next month, a week from now I guess maybe less, I'm also kinda trying to eat less I'm not sure if I am.

I'm also working on fixing an issue with my foot, I have deformation with my big toe, makes it go towards the other toes in the foot, which results in a (slight to intense) pain while walking.

And I think I'm slowly getting to the painful part. So I got something to "force it" back in place, but it's going to take time maybe about a month or more to get it back to normal, so I have to wear that as much as I can.

Wearing it is impossible with other footwear, so that means I'll walk less, but if that gonna make it hurt less in the future, then I'm ok with it, and that would be the perfect time to actually do water fasting, so I guess it's good after all

its few hours from writing the

So. I'm starting to go back to an emotional state again, I'm thinking about of how much of a failure I am, I'm 23, I don't have a job, i never really had a job for more than 2 months, I live in my parent's house, It doesn't look like I'm improving as a person, it always seems like I'm sort of a stupid person who can't learn anything, or be useful, I actually do kinda think if giving up everyday I wake up, I think that maybe if I just give up, and it would be more peaceful. I don't know.                        </p>

I don't feel like working on anything yet, hopefully today i'll totally fix my sleep schedule if no one wakes me up for no reason .

I'm writing this at the beginning of my day.

I really don't have any plans so, I don't wanna do anything too.

Feeling empty.

Still can't figure out why I'm not motivated, to do my work stuff.

Was trying to play a game and thing didn't work I have to reinstall it and being bored makes me wanna do anything, but don't want to work today I'm like incapable of thinking of how to do stuff now I'm just bored enough to start conceding yanking it, cuz it's too fukin boring now I have to wait for the game to re-install

few hours latter i didn't do that though , i been through some problems with playing that game , and i got so frustrated i reinstalled the whole system again , and thing was fixed , i did try fix it in a different way but still didn't work so yeah , but everything is back to normal .

I'm not sure what to do still I don't feel like playing the game at all anyway, I'm really unmotivated and there is nothing that I can do about it, maybe i need a punching bag ... seriously I feel frustrated AF, And probably taking some anger out is gonna solve it. I'm also tried AF, and trying to stay awake as long as possible so that I fix my sleep schedule.

Probably yankin it would be a good way to let time pass cuz I take my time doing it for some reason, like no seriously I don't take long time to finish, still I take my time doing it

Well it's like 6 pm now it's still early to sleep, so I'm not sure how I'm going to keep my self up.
Brain is like, just go have some yankin action that would technically keep me up long enough.

I'm so tired tho, and bored
didn't get to play anything really cuz brain stopped working .
hopefully i'll get working done tomorrow .                        </p>

As the title suggests I didn't really do anything today expect that I did a video for my channel stating for who ever might view my stuff, that I'm going to start over again, I also decided to change the way I'm going to record my videos
I'm going to do the commentary while recording the video so that it's less time-consuming in the end.

Hopefully things go fine.

I really want to start with my physics engine project, and I'm not sure when but I want to do that asap, I still have the university thing to worry about still, and I want to get an actual chair, I've been setting working, playing, learning and communicating on a plastic chair and i don't like it, it's not comfortable, and my ass is fukin broken, but now I might have to wait even more.

I'm getting close to fix my messed up sleep schedule, I feel exhausted when I'm waking up during the night, and I just can't get work done as effective as when I wake up during the day.

I need to get back to work soon.
So much to do with so little time, things to learn, skills to master, programs to be written.

It's going to be fun.

Maybe I'll get my self in the habit of reading again.

I learn more about how I think and how to make sure that I dont' end up leading my self to be sad for seemingly no reason                        </p>

Today I did a lot of nothing ... I actually didn't do anything today, barely some “thinking” about my project.

Also, today I did something I'm not very proud of doing which is masturbating, I was so fukin bored that i thought it would be a way to pass the time.

so my plan is, just like things become a habit after doing it for some time, I can stop doing it for some time, and it won't be a habit and then probably won't do it again, from tomorrow cuz today doesn't count now, does it ?

Starting from tomorrow I'll stop and keep my self away for a month or even more if I can, and if I find my self about to do it I'll try some form of punishment, idk exactly what it's going to be, but I'll try to make something I hate doing.

But other than that nothing happened at all                        </p>

I've done nothing today on my projects today, so nothing has been done today.

I'm still having dealing with my memories of the people I can no longer talk to, its like I'm rejecting them leaving.

It doesn't make sense at all, but overtime I see the “place” where I met them and talk to them and spent a lot of time with them, even though those memories are happy ones, they tend to make me sad when I think about them, and sometimes I just can't help at all but missing them.

I always feel like I have some unfinished business with them. And that's why I feel the urge to try to find a way to talk to them.

And I know I said that I should stop living in the past, and I'm really trying my best to stop remembering them and move on with my life I still think about them from time to another, and it saddens me that I can't talk to them anymore.

So now I spend some time in the “place” where I met them, and it does sadden me still. However, I believe if I do this enough times it the effect would get less and less effective on me.

But I also know that I still have to go through those emotions, and I can't really do much about it, even tho i don't want to go through it anymore. It is still ok to be sad sometimes, I'll try to get through it and move on to the next thing I got to do, maybe more improvements.

however, I'm not sure what to do, now I'm trying to hold onto my current relationships and build them up to be something bigger than what they are now. that's how I should probably do it.

Maybe I still can make friends, but at a much slower pace.

I'll still focus on making sure that what ever makes me happy is something that I do, something from within me, and not from someone else, but I'll also keep on trying to find a good friend.                        </p>

                             2021-02-February-14-Sunday

So today I uploaded my design to GitHub and had it containing all the content from my old design

Its working pretty well and its looks great, at least to me it does.

I'm doing progress. I refined some of the design too, I added fonts, refined how images look. I even edited the website to look fine on mobile.

I might do some changes latter but all the changes gonna be done much faster thanks to the variables I set for my style.

Now let's talk about something a bit more important, my decision which I'm still scared to take.
and it seems like I'm going to be stuck for a while, I had this idea of maybe doing something different.

The problem is not the people, the problem is me holding to the past, I need to just get over it.
I'll try to toughen my self more, I need to improve both in my skills and in my mentality.

Maybe I could try learning more things, new skill, start actually reading books and finish them.

Maybe I'll lessen the amount of communications that I do, maybe me trying to make friends is me trying to find happiness through an external source, which is not a good way to live, it well ultimately leads to me depending on others more, pushing my self on them, and probably making their life harder, until they decide to leave me and that would lead to me being sad and broken, probably not learning anything from that mistake gonna make me look for external source of happiness even harder. Not realizing I won't find it.

So now what we do. I'm not sure where to go with that now.

But I'm leaning towards not really cutting my relationship with my friends. But trying to only let it happen and not care about it too much, I'll try to be a good friend to them. Up until they stop trying to be my friend, but I'll change the way I talk to them.

Again, I need to talk less and listen more, let the awkward silence land upon us.

I'll try to also not get my self get “influenced” by other people's lifestyle. But I'll try my best to learn from mistakes.

Maybe I'll start working on the new project in few days from now.

But for now I'm feeling a bit tired and I need to fix my sleep schedule.

I also have to. Make another important decision, soon I'll have to decide whether to enroll in university or not.

I'm not sure where that would go. But also staying in place is not good so I'll have to try to enroll.

It's expensive and this is really annoying. Again I still don't have a job, and the whole thing is my father's idea in a way, hopefully that getting that degree would probably make it possible to find a job someday, but I'll try to design things in the next few weeks and have the designs up. And maybe try to sell them.

I need to find a way to make some money, maybe would be a good way to prove usefulness, not for anyone, but for myself.                        </p>

                            2021-02-February-13-Saturday

I didn't make a diary yesterday, that's cuz my sleep schedule is still all over the place

as the title suggests I'm still not sure what I should do with the people I know currently

I still can go "anti-social" without totally cutting my communication with them.

But that means I still would have communications to maintain.

But it also means if I need someone to talk to I'll probably have, and the people I know are not bad at all, I would say they are actually good people, I would love to keep talking to them too, I actually told them that I might entirely disappear.

some of them told me that it's a bad idea, and probably not a good plan, and that they would be sad / upset if I do, but it still would be my decision to take.
They told me that if it's something I need to do, they still respect that decision.

I actually feel like I'm making a too big sacrifice.

I'm going to feel really bad for a few months if I actually leave for good.

I am in a state of analysis parlsys, where I can't decide whether my decisions are good or stupid.
the risk can be higher that the reward in this case, I usually step away from this kind of sacrifice, but it does seem like I'm having some real problems, maybe social anxiety, maybe just anxiety.

I've been dealing with it for the past few years. Well maybe sense I was 10 years old, probably was dealing with something similar to anxiety until it developed itself to what i m dealing with now.

My problem is I'm never sure of anything, which is good for learning things, makes me consider that I might be on the wrong side sometimes, being able to understand people better.

The bad side is
I'm not sure of my relationship with the people I invested my time trying to know, I'm also never sure if I have a “good” skill or not.
or even cable of doing or making something usefully, what ever “usefully” suppose to mean, seems to change meaning depending on the situation.

So people are being nice to me, and I believe that they are my friends, but the problem I'm never sure if anything including that.
I've always thought people in the end would mean me harm at some point, maybe would try to use me for their own amusement.
I'm not trying to blame the past, or the people before, but that was what my experience that led me to believe, that no one would honestly be my friend.

Until my friends actually did convince me that there are some good people out there.
and I sometimes believe that I did actually find them.
and my problem is, that I keep on leaving.
and now I'm thinking, maybe I shouldn't have, but at the same time. It doesn't feel like I can really communicate with all of them, some of them seem to have really good intentions.

Some of them seem to be just there.
and that's fine, i haven't seen any ill intentions from any of them.

that's usually why i don't get attached to people. Now I'm afraid of leaving.
maybe it's time to build a solid platform. A place I can go back to.
probably after that while I'll be able to go back to my “travels” between people.

I can't keep on blaming past, it's not ok to keep on leaving people, at some point I'll be running out of options.

I spent few years learning how to talk, I should spend few more learning how not to talk.
which is actually harder to me than it sounds.

But what would be a good decision, i don't think I'm capable of taking it now.

I'm stuck.

Do I sacrifice all and crawl back into being by my self, Which going to give me a lot of time for development.
But has the risk of me getting into depression again.

I really believe that the people I have now been so valuable that this decision may not be worth it.

Or do I keep on maintaining my current relationships, and hold to my sanity, the risk would be them leaving, that's totally possible, I also tend to think that I might end up messing it up. And have all what I did ruined by me.
Would be funny that I'm scared of making a quick decision, but that's where I'm at now.

I have to decide.

I could always lurk for a while until I feel better about my current situation, it's time to take care of how I feel about something I guess. can't believe I said that.

But I'll also make sure there is room for improvement.

Soon I'll update my personal website.

I've been thinking of buying a domain name and having a server to host my page on.

And things would work fine, hopefully.

Now that I've gotten really good with designing, I think it's time to make a few more templates and sell them to people.

Probably can make a profit out of few templates. Finally .

                    <h3>A tough decision</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                             2021-02-February-11-Thursday

So again today I did nothing, i m still thinking about the decision that I'm going to take that I'm really not sure about all, It's hard to decide what direction I should go, the coast of both ways could be very high.

So I decided yesterday to just go back to be anti-social, but the decision is, should I leave and have a new start, or should I just keep what I have and what I have now and move on.

What I mean is the friends that I made up to this moment.

Should I tell them all that I don't want to talk to them anymore, that would be really rude and probably selfish.
that means I'll sacrifice what ever friendship I made in the past few years.

That means I'll be able to go around without worrying about maintaining communications, and I can start again and try to make new friends.

The price would be all those friends that I made so far, and even tho I was complaining, about things yesterday.
It's not really the whole story, things have been happening between me and them, I still think they are great people, I still think maybe they consider me a friend, I still think they could be more than just people I knew on the internet.

But still a part of me saying that, probably most of these people don't really like me. Probably I'm just there to fill the gap when it exists, a placeholder, something not really useful but could be used sometimes when the good things are not available.

Which is an idea that makes me want to cry every day, feeling useless, or worthless, but ... that's the life of a loser, it's not really fun, it's not exiting, but someone has to go through it.

Yes I'll try to improve, yes I'll try to make something out of my self, yes I'll try.

But no way I can know for sure that things well get better.

Just because I want something really bad , doesn't mean I'm going to have it, that's the reality of life.

I'm not saying my life is the worst, I'm just going through a hard time ... mentally, I'm trying to overcome, I'm trying to adapt, I'm trying to forget.

But still that's like, you have to go through the bad time, so you do feel really good when good times come.

Hopefully they do.                        </p>

                    <h3>A point of change</h3>

                             2021-02-February-10-Wednesday

Today I haven't done any work at all that's not the main topic of today's diary but I'll get something out of the way

I'm thinking the masturbation problem is getting worst somehow, but I think have a solution for it soon, hopefully well get red of it.

So today I've been going I've been thinking about, turning into the anti-social person that I used to be, maybe a less extreme version of it.
And I already did give a heads-up to my current friends that still talk to me that I might even give everything up.

Completely forcing my self to be on my own.

And I'm not sure where this well take me. I know for a fact that I'll be feeling bad for a while as soon as I start doing that.

It's important to note that, cuz I'll have no one to talk or vent to. Which is something I try to do is find someone to listen to me when I'm having problems, but I'll try to only keep for myself. Which is a heavy load, and I was thinking that, it's probably only me who well listen to what I have to say, there are really few people who would do that if I needed to.

I know that expecting people to be help / talk to me is probably asking too much for whom am I as a person, I know this sounds like a cry for help in someway it is not.

So here is the thing, I'm not a very interesting person, I'm kind of boring, and I'm starting to think that I'm might be stupid, or maybe have low IQ cuz it seems like probably learning things is not the easy thing for me, or maybe I'm expecting too much from me.

So hopefully I'll be able to handle all the negative feelings that I've been dealing with, I usually ignore anything has to do with feelings and try to work on my things and try to make something's out of them, but it's been increasingly getting worst and worst recently.

To the point where I can't ignore them, and I'll see where that take me. I'll try to go back to work in the next few days, I'm not feeling well physically, it's like I'm getting sick again. hopefully not think too bad.

I still really love the people I still talk to. But I think I'm getting my self somewhat too attached, or maybe I think that people stop communicating I just end up thinking it's entirely my fault, which is not good at all.

yeah, so this might be a really important point of change. I'll be tying to improve more, I'll try to complain less.

I'll do my best.                        </p>

                            2021-02-February-09-Tuesday

Today I did nothing.

I was just trying music play that I can use in my system. I actually re-installed the whole system too, felt like it was using a lot of my computer's resources so i thought I might as well do it.

But with this topic aside, today I woke up and I was still dealing with negative thoughts about my self.

Thinking that I'm worthless, and basing that on

How it seems like people won't try to ... talk to me or spend anytime with me unless I'm the only option they have at the time, and that it doesn't look like they take me seriously, or think that I'm a stupid person.

When it comes to communications I'm always the person who has to keep the communication going, otherwise it won't continue, or at least that what it always seems to be the case for me.

And that I also have no source of income, I don't have a job, not many activities other than programming, designing, playing games and watching videos.

I'm starting to think that I can't do anything anymore. That I'm welling to give up on my projects, which is all I have at this point.

I tried to reach for an “old friend” just to ask them how they're doing and properly say goodbye to them one last time, but I think they don't want anything to do with me anymore.
I feel like it was my mistake, even tho they were acting in a way that I won't be able to talk to them if I wanted, but they get to talk to me almost any time they wanted, in a way that made me feel like I'm just the last “thing” on the list, and I'm starting to believe that.

Maybe it is something about me, maybe I'm just an annoying person, maybe I should go back to being an anti-social break away from society. Maybe that's for the better for me.

I'll stop trying to communicate with others, I'll play the hard to get game. I'll stop reaching for others.

I feel exhausted, maybe I managed to socialize with people very well, but still can't make what it seems like a friendship.

I might be naive to think about it this way, but when none of my “new friends” even ask how am I doing in more than few months, for me, it kinda gives me an idea about how much value do I hold in these people's mind, probably. Nothing.

Problem with most my communications is that they all are online.
And I can't really try to make friends in real life cuz I don't see people at all, there is a pandemic and people need to stay home.

I don't have a job to go to, the only thing I'm going to end up with is other collage students who are even more stupid than me, they are naive, they are not even interesting, and the only thing they have to talk about is sex, money, fame and looks.
Now, I know not all collage students are like that, but let's be honest most of them are.

Maybe I'm complaining too much, maybe I'm talking none sense, I don't know what's going on in my brain, I need to get whatever going on in my brain diagnosed, but I can't afford it, I'm too broke for it.

Feeling useless, feeling worthless, regretting my decisions, always blaming my self even for things that I probably shouldn't be blamed for, always feeling like I'm not enough.

That's why I'm not welling to invest in a “romantic” relationship at all, I know that if end up with someone that is even a little messed up in the head, they will manipulate me, probably use me for whatever comes to their mind, and they just get rid of me, and leave me to put the blame on my self.

I'm welling to risk a lot of things, but not my sanity.

I don't know when this is going to end, or how it's going to impact me, but I decided I'm going silent.
I'll keep writing my diary of course, but when it comes to communications I'll just stop.

I always focused on solving the problem before taking care of how I feel about it, now all I want is for the feelings to go, I tired of feeling like a useless, worthless being, that no one is welling to spend time with, or even just asking about.

I'm actually on the verge of crying as I'm writing this, I've been like this for 2-3 days, I've been resisting that all the time, maybe I should give in, maybe I would get some relief there.

I used to be anti-social, it's time for me to go back to being that again.

The piece of mind is really important to me now.                        </p>

                    <h3>Finished with anxiety</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                             2021-02-February-08-Monday

Good news, I finished the whole website design. Every thing is done it looks good and.

I finally can start working on the back end soon

I have to make videos about it and upload them, then try to star with the back end I make it work well

I stayed up from yesterday until 12 am this day and throughout the whole time I was feeling like I lost something, all the time thinking that I don't have any value at all.

And what I did, is I started saying what on my mind in a discord server that is for my friend, they said I can say what ever I want there, so I did say this :

not gonna lie ... I think that I really don't believe in my self and I probably should XD, it's probably the biggest problem about me.

Always thought that I'm a “loser” docent seem like I have value, every day I think of just giving up on what I'm doing.
Not sure how long I can hold on.
But I can hope that I don't just give up.

If anything goes wrong I tend to blame my self for it, I do that all the time.

Docent seem like people take me seriously when I talk to them, always feels like whoever I'm talking to, they see me as a stupid/naive kid,
Really hated that when I was younger, still do hate it, but I guess leading people to think that I'm not interesting or stupid to lead them away from talking to me.
problem is no one to talk to. When I need that.
End up being some weirdo who talks to him self most the time.
So now people also think that I'm crazy XD "

So ... that happened I was really missing the old friends that I cant get in contact with anymore
was thinking maybe I'm not worth anything for them and that's probably why they left me, but it's probably not the case.
at least I hope it is.

So the plan is I want to re-install my system again after I wake up, cuz I think I didn't maintain it well yet.

But that was is for today
I hope that the anxiety goes away soon.

Anyway I got things working the way I want it in my pc now, I want to upload videos of me developing my website, and I want to start working on my first big project (the 2d physics engine), hopefully it goes well. It's gonna take me years to learn all the things I need to learn, but hopefully it will be fun, I'm looking forward to start learning again.                        </p>

Nothing really happened, the reason I wrote this is cuz I'm trying to keep on writing them every day.

So … I couldn't sleep until 6-7 am today, and I woke up at 2-3 pm, I got up toke a shower and ate, found out that it was 6-7pm and decided that I was bored, and I wanted to play some video games, and now I'm writing this at 11pm.

I have no idea how, but I wasted a lot of time and I can't really do anything about it.

I can't go to sleep now anyway, I'll try to work and finish the project's design today. And see what else is missing. And I'll try to finish that too, I'll probably start working after an hour of writing this diary.                        </p>

I almost finished the design today, but ... couldn't finish, last thing I have to do. Which is dragging and dropping pictures, it's all what's left.

I did the theme today

I think I got rid of few lines from my styles file

Not much left, I'm actually getting more and more excited to work on the project again, hopefully things stay this way.

Maybe someday, I'll be actually efficient in my work.

Not much to document other than, I'll be trying to lower the amount of code as much as possible.

I want it to be fast and functional I'm thinking of starting the physics engine soon in about a week, so let's see how that goes

That's it for today, it was good                        </p>

                            2021-02-February-05-Friday

So today I was checking on my CSS file didn't really do much I slept at 11pm and woke up at 5am, was still somewhat tired through the whole day.

But was about to make a switch thing which should have taken me 10 min to finish but then, the people who installed the whole AC thing in my room came, because we had some stuff that we couldn't finish, they actually my neighbors.

So wasn't really annoying, but when they were done I was feeling tired, and I couldn't really go back to work.

I still have a good idea about what I'm going to do tomorrow anyway, and I also managed to stay up till 10pm witch means I'm going to have a stable sleep schedule, and I'll be back on the progress.

I was thinking of what more functionality I can add to my project so that it does make sense for people to actually use it, and I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to do.

But hopefully I'll get more ideas as I'm building it.

I'm going to try to finish the whole thing tomorrow, I should be able to do that.

Then all I have to do the videos about the project itself.

Hopefully that goes fine.

But we all know, shit usually hits the fan.                        </p>

                    <h3>Tired</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2021-02-February-04-Thursday

I basically did nothing today other than talking to my friends I couldn't not do work I couldn't really play anything I was too tired all the time.

Well, I did manage to fail the whole try not to masturbate thing... Talking about this is actually embarrassing as fuck . But I kinda don't care too. Again, it seems like it's some kind of routine thing that repeats itself every 4-6 days. At least I see some form of routine here, that can be broken I believe if I wasn't bored enough.

I wasn't feeling well too, I'm still not feeling very well at the time of righting this.

My sleep schedule is allover the place. that's why there is one day missing, It's because I stay up till 6am-11am.

I wake up at 8pm which means some days I cant stay up for 12 hours, that's not good.

I'm writing this at 12pm tho I would normally be sleep but was surprised, that my father (yes I still live in my parent's house) decided to install an AC in my room for some reason, I didn't know.

Not going to lie I'm kinda against the idea, cuz I'm afraid this well end up coasting us more in the long term, it still is good to have specially in the summer, cuz we get like 45C here for few weeks in some years.

It also has to do with that it makes me feel dependent in a way, like I can't get that on my own, it's an annoying thing that fucks with my mind every now and then .

So yeah the guy that suppose to install this thing is coming today, I can't sleep in my room.

I slept in the at 7am and woke up at 9 am actually and now I can't go back to sleep.

So maybe today i'll be able to fix my sleep schedule .

I'm not feeling well tho, for some reason my stomach is hurting I guess. I can't feel... whatever muscle tensing every now and then , not too painful, but it's annoying, actually feels like I'm sick, or about to be.

I actually tried to work on the project today I just couldn't get things done, my eyes and my whole body feels heavy, my movement is slow, and my brain is not working very well, I decide to write this now even I could stay p for a bit longer, just in case I forget to do that.

Now it's 8pm that's about 8 hours after I wrote everything above
we are done with the insulation, unfortunately there was a problem we ran into and i cant use the AC yet, they gonna come back tomorrow to fix it, we couldn't do that today cuz it started raining heavily, I actually enjoy rain weather thing. Was relaxing to listen to the water falling from the sky.

I'm about to go to sleep probably in 30 minutes, I still felt tired through the day, but I guess it was normal I didn't really sleep more than 2 hours. And hopefully that well fix my sleep schedule now.

I really hope I have at least some energy to work tomorrow

I also really want to mean the new people I met yesterday

so let's hope for the best and see where every thing goes from here                        </p>

                        <p>
                            2021-02-February-03-Wednesday

Today I didn't do any work, all I did is just playing Minecraft.

And after I was done, I decided to play VR-chat, a game where you go online and talk to random people in a virtual reality environment.
People can design avatars (takes a lot of work and still) which makes them chose what they look like. So you don't really see what people actually look like identical to, but that makes it so that you can see and talk to a person.

It gives some sort of feeling that this place alive.
You are talking to real people. They are actually real.

And that's the whole purpose of this “game” is to actually communicate with people in that environment, and its is fun, it's serious, it's annoying. It's an elevated form of what social media was supposed to be like.

I played that game a lot before. And I decided to go back to it again after I left it for few months, when decided to re-design my project that I'm currently working on.

And it was actually nice, I met new nice people, and I'm kinda excited to meet and talk to them again.
I'm just worried that, it would stop me from progressing.
but, I'll try my best to actually do the work before anything else from now on.

The sad part about me going back to, is I used to have friends in there that, some of them don't want to talk to me anymore, and some of them haven't played the game in a long time, some of them I just haven't seen in log time and seem like they probably stopped playing, and the way the game works is also players can make a publishing “places” and you can “join” these places and that's where you would meet people.

Some of these places, I still go to, are places I used to spend time with my friends in that “game” . And I'll be having a good time, but also, the pace reminds me of talking to those old friends, it makes me sad that I can't talk to them ago.

It's like I lost something that is so valuable.

One of them I decided to leave instead, I was trying to say goodbye to them, and I couldn't, so i just “unfriended” them then. Thinking that would be good for both of us.
So now, I tried to look for them and sent them a friend request, just wanted to properly say goodbye this time.

I miss them and I really would like to talk to them or at least say goodbye to them one last time.

I'll try to stop thinking about the past, I need to keep living the in the present.                        </p>

                    <h3>Doing the big think</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2021-02-February-02-Tuesday

So today I actually didn't do any progress to my website, I don't know why tbh I got distracted with games actually .

But I also was thinking about a Project/2D physics engine/Introduction project, I want to make it so that it's as optimized as possible, so that's going to take a lot of time again I'm planing to work on it for the next 5 years.

I want things like cloth simulation, fluid dynamics “water simulation”, destructive objects, friction, attaching and detaching “objects” to each other, gravity.
almost everything I can think of.

So I ran into the problem of choosing the “best” programming language for the task,
and so far it seems like C is the best for this.

The reason that I say the “best” programming language and why I would have to learn a new one has to do with the purpose of the programming language itself and also how fast it actually works.

Some programming languages are made for applications, some are made for systems, some are made for websites.

And some of them are “easier” to get work done with than others.
that depends on the level of the language.
High level are used in applications and such, low levels are used for systems.
but generally it means the languages itself deals with the hardware in a “specific way"
lower level languages communicate with hardware better.
And that means I would have much better understanding of what kind of resources I'm using.

But that means I have to learn a different way of programming.
So i what I'm used to is Objects Oriented Programming(OOP), which ties data with objects, this may result in different objects having the same kind of data but a different variable, that are going to be made in different times during the execution.

Data Oriented Programming

Deals with data that is already known what it's going to be and separates it from “functions" or operations that are going to be applied on this data, and you won't need to make different “Objects” that have similar “properties” that are going to be handled in different stages.
The data can be used sort of “globally” so you wouldn't need to make variables inside the objects.
Resulting in dealing with less unnecessary work. Maybe It's going to also be easier to clean the memory from the “no longer needed” data in the memory.

And after so far after the small research I've done, it seems like C is going to be the best language I can use for the task for now.

And in the next few weeks I'm going to try to have that happening, and I'll try to make a small play area. And have a “box” fall, and I'll see where it goes from there.

So yeah, I got distracted with those 2 things.

Tomorrow my plan is to make the log-in/sign-up page for the user and maybe make the "edit | delete | follow” option for the posts, and making dragging and dropping pictures a thing

Hopefully I'll get that done tomorrow I'll try to work more actually .

But other than that, nothing happened.                        </p>

                    <h3>Almost done</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2021-01-January-31-Sunday

So today I made some progress, actually almost totally done with the design, I have to do next is just the options for the user to edit or delete, their posts which should be ease to do it's just a menu that appears when you click on it, and the ability to drag and drop one or multiple pictures.
And the expanding of the form section when users enter too much content, so they have more view, and it's going to be useful when users add the pictures, they can see them, and they can delete anyone they don't want to “upload”.

This sounds like a lot of work, but I'm sure I can get it done in 1 or 2 days. It's mostly things that I have already done before.
There is no “re-design” process to go through, there might be some complicated stuff, but for the most part It's going to be an east thing to get done.

I didn't really do a lot of work today, but still some progress is better than none.
The more I practice, the more I want to work for longer hours.

However, I'm still failing on the whole 'trying not to masturbate' issue every 4-5 days.

I'm trying to not make it happen, but really sometimes I only do it cuz I'm bored or cuz I can't really sleep.

Anxiety levels are still lower than usual, I can't say that this diary is the cause of that, but it seems like it. I'm not complaining tho, less anxiety is good for me right now.

I need to find a new community, tho. I actually left the one I was in a few weeks ago.
Something happened there, a person who was a friend of mine got some drama going on, They didn't like that some of us didn't have the same view as they did.
And decided to leave, but they also toke a chunk of other friends with Them, which made it look like turning people on each other.

It wasn't entirely his fault, tho.

But it is what it is, after that I decided to leave a bit earlier than I planned.

And now I need some communities.

I still contact with some people that I got to know through that community.

Some of them I knew before, and that community made me realize there are some really good people out there.

I'm not gonna mention names but for those people if by any chance you're reading this …

I love you guys, I don't know where I would be now if I didn't get to talk to people like you.                        </p>

                    <h3>NO progress</h3>

So as the title suggests I didn't do any progress today, I was thinking about it all the time but didn't feel like doing.

And this is a problem, that I don't work because I didn't feel like.
I don't even think taking decisions based on feelings is a good thing.

I'll try to avoid that a lot I only spent this day playing Minecraft, cuz I felt like I want to play a game, entertainment is important, but work is important too.

I should try to balance this, someday it's all work and no entertainment, some are all entertainment and no work.
That doesn't really look like a good plan.

I'll see what I can do about it, but that was it for today nothing much happened today, in general it was one of those boring days when everything feels slow and nothing really is happening.

At least I did piece together what I want the last few designs to be like, so I'll work on that tomorrow and make it a thing, also been thinking about depression for some reason, I wasn't depressed, but I was thinking about it.

I am worried about future though, cuz I don't know what might happen.
And now we're in a pandemic, I can't find a job, I'm relaying on my father who wants me to attend university which is expensive.

That decision has to be taken in less than a month from now, and I don't think I have much choice, it's the only investment I have, this pandemic is going to keep things the way it is for at least another 2-3 years.
Which is roughly the time it's going to take me to finish my university, so might as well take the chance since I'm not finding any jobs.

Nothing serious happened, so all is fine.                        </p>

So if anyone is reading this, and you are dealing with any kind of similar problems, please reach out for help, I know it doesn't feel right to ask others.

You might think that you don't want to bother others with your problem, you might think that it's weakness to seek for help, might think that this situation is something to be ashamed of.

You might think any sort of thought that suggests that's asking for help is a bad thing to do, but it's not, don't get your self stuck in here, there is a way out. Anyone can find it, but at this point help is needed , please reach out for it.

This diary is going to be in my personal website. And in a social media website that I'm making right now, so even tho there is some embarrassing shit in here.

There is also some serious problems that I'm still dealing with and trying to overcome, and maybe someone else is dealing with this problem, and this might help them.

But fortunately this time, it didn't happen I'm not sure why, but again it could be anxiety, since I started writing this diary I'm having less anxiety to deal with.
So maybe that's why.

But anyway that's it for today, it wasn't bad, it wasn't the best progress I've done but its is some and progress is back and hopefully is going to improve a bit more.                        </p>

                            2021-01-January-27-Wednesday

So, I know I've said I would do the dairy every day, but i ... let's say got busy. So yeah I'm sorry, to my self I guess.

But what I've been trying to do for a week, was trying to mount my computer on a wall instead of having it inside a case.
The reason for that is I was kind of annoyed of it eventually.
So I have a piece of wood that would fit my whole PC.

And started working. With the help of my father. Thankfully we have some power tools to play around with.
But the goal was also to do it only with what we have in the house.
And I started looking a room I'm happy I did the mounted PC thingy have outside the actual house contains a lot of stuff, some of it is older than me .

And I was looking around and got what I need, started working.
3 days of work and it was done.

And here it is
</p><div class="images"><img src="./img/IMG_20210109_23261asdf.jpg" alt=""><img src="./img/IMG_20211104_173110.jpg" alt=""></div> <p>

So there was also 2 days wasted thinking what stuff to use for mounting the PC.

So now ht can only hear one fan only while it's working at full force. The reason is that my computer is in the same room and when it was in the case, it was too annoying to try to sleep while it's running.
And I'm trying to have my computer on almost all the time, I won't actually do that ALL THE TIME. But sometimes I'll need to have it on for a few days or few weeks.

And unfortunately I didn't work on my project at all during that time I was being lazy sometimes, the other times I was working on desk.

So the plan now is tomorrow I will finish the website's design. cuz there isn't much to do.
I'll try and redo that on an older version, record it, edit it then record an explanation to what I'm doing. Then upload that to YouTube and LBRY/Odyssey.

And after that I need to start working on the back end. And hopefully buy the end of the next month I'll have the project working as I want it to work.

And that was it for the past week, no more too busy days to do the dairy. I'm happy I did the mounted PC thing, now I'll be free to do what I want. Hopefully gain experience.
And start working on the other projects soon.

I'm currently using a text editor that I don't really like, but it's the best I could find that works, it's called "lifeograph" it's not bad.

I just didn't like the way it worked.

So I'm going to make one that is better for me at least.
Have good day.

I'M back after few a week for not having a computer to work on

I “accidentally” almost totally wrecked My bios, and I didn't have the tools to fix it myself, so I had to drop it at a repair shop
It took a week, but I think it should have taken less than that, and I think they fixed it, but they didn't call me
It was one of the slowest weeks I ever lived.

During that period I tried to do things that my PC would get in the way of me doing it. I took old PC pats that we have, and I got the fans inside of them in order to use them somewhere else.
The plan was to use them in my case but, I decided I'm going to mount my PC parts on a piece of wood and that that piece of wood mounted to the wall.

I also “made” a new disk for myself, I felt like I needed more space and I think I talked about this in the last diary, and sense my computer was not there I decided I can mount the wood piece we have in the house and make a much larger space to play with than before about 3-4 times the size.

The problem.
Well, boredom makes me ... do things that I actually don't really want to do, but since I had nothing else to do I'll do what ever comes out in my stupid brain to waste time faster.
So what I did is that I got back to wasting my time with masturbation, not all the time cuz that would be ridiculous.
But I see that this problem is much bigger than I expected it would be. I'm going to do my best in fighting it.
The more I do it the more I'm going to talk about it, it's embarrassing AF , and I'm going to have this available to who ever decides to read this.
I don't want to be seen as a guy who does nothing but masturbate when he's bored.

I do work
I have few projects, I'm still working on
I was able to make a desk instead of just paying someone to do it for me, i m mounting my PC on a piece of wood.
I'm trying to learn things, I'm trying to improve as a person, be useful, independent.
I still end up being really anxious about my self, especially when I'm about to sleep.
However, I noticed before my PC get wrecked since I started doing this diary, I'm feeling less and less anxious.
I'm gonna try to keep this going.
I should have writer this like 2 days ago, but there is a reason why that didn't happen

Breakdown of progress
So when I got my PC fixed, for some reason the computer didn't want to boot into my system. I didn't know why.
And I decided not to fix it, and just reset everything again, I can reconfigure that my self I've done it enough times now I know how it goes.
And it was fine until the tonight it seemed like I almost killed my bios today, so I decided I'll reset it before anything bad happens.

So I'll be back in a few days to progress, tomorrow I'm gonna have to go visit some family, but I might not go.
I'm doing this diary at 3 am, but I'm doing it for the day before.

And today I'll try to do another diary regardless of something interesting happen or not, or I do some progress or not
I'm going to do this everyday now.
Maybe it's going to help with my anxiety.
I'll see how it is.

Here are pictures of my old and new disk
this is the old one
</p><div class="images"><img src="./img/IMG_20210115_004335.jpg" alt=""></div> <p>

This is the new one, I can flip it too, idk why, but I decided why not have that

And that's the end result

So the reason I want to mount the PC well more room to use on the new desk also it's loud sometime, and having it mounted on the wall means I don't have to worry about having fans in the case, cuz there is no case anymore.                        </p>

So today I have not worked on my project at all so not much to report about it but, tomorrow I'll force my self to work as much as possible I'll aim for about 6-8 hours of production which should finish the rest of the design for my project if I don't decide to change anything about it.

So recently I was dealing with “over heating” problems with my PC, my CPU would get to 40-50 on idle which is not normal and not good.
Usually the best move is to get a new thermal paste and apply it for my CPU or getting a new heat sink, but I decided I don't want to spend money at all.

So I decided to try and increase the cooling efficiency, by removing the front panel of my case, that worked well, and it dropped to 30-40 on idle which is great, but it's better than what I started with, so I realized if I keep the front panel opened a lot of dust would get in, so I removed the front panel material, so now it's just a frame, and I'm going to have a dust filter to stop the dust from going in and i, have maximum air flow.


</p><div class="images"><img src="./img/IMG_20210109_232637.jpg" alt=""></div> <p>

I also did manage the cables, so the thing doesn't look messy.

</p><div class="images"><img src="./img/IMG_20210109_2326172.jpg" alt=""></div> <p>

Now I realize that I need more air flow, but I decided not to buy fans, and what I did is I toke old computer's CPU fans cleaned them, and I'm planing to mount them to my case, but it was dark outside at that point and most material I need are in the back yard for my house and I decided I'll do it tomorrow.

Unfortunately it's not totally free cuz even though I have the fans I can't have all of them before I get a cable that allow me to connect multiple fans, but that is hopefully going to be easy to find.

And that was it for today.

I'm not working on the project and that's, cuz I'm thinking about the new desk that I need to make and taking measurements, I was about to buy a whole set of fans but decided against it, I don't want to spend money in them, I want to save the money for a better PC and more storage, cuz I don't have a lot of it.

I'll be going back to the project full force as soon as I'm done making my new desk, though.

But I'm glad I found out that. I can make use of old things and I can find actually solution for problems without having to replace something completely or pay to fix something.

And that did make me feel good about my self. I guess I won't have anxiety tonight, and I'm glad to think that.

                            2021-01-January-08-Friday

So today I did the measurements for what going to be my new desk, and it does seem like I'll have a lot more space to work with once we're done making it, it could take us few days maybe 2 weeks max, but I'm excited.

Now today I actually didn't do much in my project, I only did the background picture and the profile picture for the about page that's going to be made for every user. It tokes me longer than I thought it would, but it's functional in chrome based and Firefox based browser.

Wasn't a very eventful day.
I spent the day on a voice chat with people I knew for a while, and it was interesting for the most part, the people I was talking to were getting drunk, and i kind of started to notice people appear more for who they actually are then they are drunk , and I learned a lot that , some people are really arrogant, some of them are good people, which is to be expected .

And it was interesting when some of them said that, they think I'm a good person, and that they respect me.
I'm kind of not used to hear good things about my self from other people, it does feel like I'm ... welcomed, but I would usually say that I'm probably not a good person, and probably there are things that are wrong with me, if I need to fix it.

I tend to think that I'm not a good person, not very useful or not good enough to do “things” and this thought keep going for few hours, usually the time before I sleep. I'm not sure why this happens.

But I can't help but think this way, some people “say” I'm a bad person some of them said that I'm actually a good person.

Maybe it's some to do with me.

But that's something for me to figure out in the future.                        </p>

So this well be a bit different that the past diaries.

First of all
I didn't do any progress , on my project I started the day by waking up trying to clean my computer, found out that my thermal paste got my CPU and heat sink stuck to each other and ripped the CPU off — it's AMD CPU — and I don't know if that effected my CPU from inside or the socket I hope it's good, but we're going to find out, for got that you have to change the thermal paste when you remove the fan and I can't even buy thermal paste.

I can make it survive for a while before anything bad happen.

But that's about it for the technical stuff.

We got visitors (family) today and, it was an interesting visit to say the least. I was talking to my uncle who is a Carpenter about a piece of wood suitable to be used as a “disk” and have it mounted on the wall so that i don't even move it around in the room, was surprised that i don't need that much material and it won't coast me much.

So that means I'll have more space in my disk, witch i'm going to need eventually. So that's a t least a good thing.

Now to the different part.
Note : you might have a different take on the topic, this is just my opinion. And I'm a bit biased when it come to this topic.
This might disturb someone who's reading, but i don't care CUZ here where I get to express what I really think about something anyway, so you hear purely to know what I think about what. Getting mad at me for it is a waste of your time.

So I'm from a country called Jordan, this country is next to a “state” that I believe should've never existed known as Israel, today i “met” someone from there in a voice chat section on discord(voice + text communication program) and was the first time I see them and so were Curious to where they are from, and they replied Israel, and I don't exactly remember how it went political, but I believe it was about his accent first, then about where he lives, and then they are talking about working with Arab people in the “state” they live in, and mentions something about they “state's” practices and that he does not agree with it.

And that they wish that the issue in this area can be resolved.
And here where me and another person, in that voice chat, had some things to say.
We basically said we don't think that Israel shouldn't exist as it is now, and it should be dismantled and people should live somewhere else.

Now he replied with “i don't agree with that” , and we started arguing about this topic.
and we had some back and forth on the topic, my last conclusion about this issue is that. It can't be resolved .

And the best way to do that is :
1- to disarm both parties. (which is impossible)
2- remove old people that were in power from both parties out of the whole system .(which is impossible)
3- have the people who been kicked out of their land back, that means they have to be moved from a lot of places they are in now back to Palestine. (which is impossible)
4- resolve the (people who live in the taken land) issue. (which is impossible)
5- also probably suing all the old leaders for war crimes. Because we have good enough evidence to back that up. (which is impossible)

And their argument was we need to solve this problem peacefully

But. . . Regardless of how (Jews been abused) in history, that doesn't justify, an army invading land destroying the houses of citizen — still happening to this day — and also killing the citizen including children, women, old me who can't fight back, destroying farmer lands, forcing the people out of the whole country, and also coming up with a “solution” for the people who been kicked out of their land with something they called “alternative country” as they did refer to Jordan witch has a big amount of its population that is Palestinian , so that “now they just stay here its fine “.

On top of all that, Jews are not the only people who suffered throughout history, so that argument wouldn't make sense, and there is this weird argument of. We were here first thousands years ago, which absolutely does not make any kind of sense , Jews were not the first people there, there were people before them and also those people were not the first people there and not the ones before them.

It doesn't make sense to me that, this would be even considered a valid argument against war crimes and almost committing homicide.

To be fair to them, they said that he wouldn't argue about this being a good reason.

But I did tell him something

That in order to solve the problem, all the steps above have to be done.

also, you need to find a way to compensate the damage done to the country and people who were in it.

But that also means that you're most likely with all the people in the “state” you live in have to leave.

To which he didn't agree with -understandably- he has his own view points and i have mine.

But I had to say at the end
“you can't say I want to solve the problems peacefully but i also would like to keep the land that has been taken away from the people who been forced out, things don't click together this way "                        </p>

                    <h3>Progress and problems</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                             2021-01-January-06-Wednesday

Today I was able to do some progress after 2 days of wasted time on things that are not so important, as I expected i didn't progress that much, that usually happens when I stop for few days and then try to start again.

But some progress is better than no progress at all.

I have also been trying to lose weight, I'm not sure if I am losing weight or not, I go out for a 1-hour walk/sprint, I do spend as much energy as I can during the walk, I used to be somewhat at some point, so I still know how to work out properly, also I'm trying to eat less food and drink more water.
That usually helps, I'm trying to eat half the amount of food I usually do now and also trying to work out every day.

However, today seems to have had an impact on my feet, I'm not sure what the problem is but, the joint at the start of my feet hurts a lot after I walk or run.
I also have another problem with the other feet where I have my big toe a bit deformed, and it makes walking a bit of default for the first 10-20 min, but the pain goes after that.

My feet still hurts at after the activity, I know that's not always a bad sign, but this one doesn't seem right, I'll try and see a doctor when i can afford it .

Unfortunately is not all positive news, as I still notice my problem with masturbation , but at least I have a hint, boredom. This could have been avoided actually if I just did something else, I was done with my work for the day and when i had nothing i just though i wanna do something and for some reason thought that I had nothing else, it also annoys me that I also go out of my way and look for pornographic content which makes me keep going with the masturbation problem as if its normal, so I need to think of a way to make that much, much harder to get to. I'm not sure how, but I'll try something. Also, I know now that all I need to do is to busy my self with other things. So maybe more activity or just play video games would help.

I'll be more focused on that problem from now on, I'll also try to work more on my project.

For today, I've designed the blog page and posts and also fixed some repeated code issues I'll do that again and I'll record and upload that, so maybe people well learn from it.                        </p>

                    <h3>Distractions</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2021-01-January-05-Tuesday

So for the past day I've been busing my self with customizing the way most of my programs look.
And it did take me a while, i actually re-installed my whole OS, and it may sound like (not bad) idea, but the problem is it does seem to be distracting me from doing what I should be doing.

All that time could have been used to learn new skills, progressing in my projects, yet I chose something else that does take effort, it does make me learn something.
But the things I get from doing it is almost in valuable compared to the main goal.

So easy to get my self busy by doing something that take effort yet have so little value instead of working on something that's far more important , has way higher value in the end, it could be what ever — lizard brain — me trying to do to steer me away from working on things , by making me do something that takes effort, to use it as an excuse to say " I'll do that tomorrow " .

But at least I do realize this distraction, it's interesting that it does happen, and I'll try my best to fight it. Hopefully I'll be working back on my projects the next day, since this day is already done .

Learning that I could be the thing stopping myself from progressing is valuable by itself so maybe it wasn't a total waste.

Nothing about my projects to report today, unfortunately.                        </p>

                    <h3>Improving</h3>


                    
                    

                        <p>
                            2021-01-January-04-Monday

So for the past few days I was working on my website, I've done some improvements and made things look a bit better

I'm trying to learn (C) programming language now, and I'm it seems pretty doable for me, I probably can do that in few days, maybe i'll have simple game running, and I'll get some understanding on how data structure works in that language.

but that's it for my programming part, some improvements been happening I do enjoy what I do, and it boosts my mood when i see my self doing progress.

Problems
I'm trying to fit some reading in my schedule, and sometimes it seems hard, I'm not totally sure why but I might just lack the motivation.
Recently I can't really sleep on time , or wake up on time , and I have a masturbation problem . . . that's probably embarrassing for people to point or even write down, just in case someone sees it.

For me, I'd rather write that down my self to at least point out the problem, as it might help me go through it. I don't like it after I masturbate or don't enjoy it in the end, I have no idea why I keep doing it, but I realize that it is effecting my life in a bad way and a solution is needed , and I'll do my best to control what ever (desire / addiction) that might be, I'll try to stop and never come back , and I'll make sure that I write that down here .

This takes me to a next issue which is a problem a lot of people facing now days, overweight, I am at the level of obesity and that's not good I was fine with being fat for long time, I didn't care, but recently it feels like its annoying me, I don't like not fitting in my old clothes , the feeling of being heavy with every movement I do , even setting down feels like I have so much fat in the way .
so i'm starting to actually get the habit of eating less and exercising. Right now I weigh about 85 kg, and I'm 160 cm tall that's like 5.2
and that's too much body mass for my height, yes I'm short, I don't really mind that. Although I do notice some disadvantage .

Another problem I'm trying to get rid of, is feeling so tired when waking up, it does take me a while before i get out of my bed.
I'm not exactly sure what might cause that even tho I do get enough hours of sleep, it still ends up feeling exhausted when I wake up, I'm thinking it could be a side effect of what I eat , my weigh , what time I sleep maybe something with my bed itself.

so I'm in the process of trying to improve my self , maybe make my life a bit easier .                        </p>

My journal experience
so this is going to be the first page i write about this

This is going to be an interesting experiment, I'll be attempting to document my days
almost every day
I'll be writing my progress and my mental state, goals and what I want to achieve, difficulties that i am facing

Introducing my self
I'm a 23 years old on the time of writing this document

I'm a beginner programmer, I'm interested in computers, philosophy, and psychology.

At the time of writing this I'm working on a project,a website, where no censorship is taking place everyone is allowed .

the main idea is to talk about topic no matter how silly or serious the topic is.

i believe that having the ability to discuss any kind of topic between people with different opinions well lead us to have a better understanding of that topic , witch might lead us to solve problems we are facing .

preventing the ability to discus topics for sensitivity reasons , would lead to a disaster; due to the lack of discussing topics , it may be miss understood and this would lead us into making a problem out of the situation or , making the problem worst by choosing the wrong way to solve it .

everyone deserves to say what they think , even if it was totally wrong . discussion it self makes solving
problems way more efficient

future projects
i have few things in mid to work on in the future

1- i want to learn the "C" programming language , and i want to make a physics engine
one that works on "small scale", with the ability to make video games that might use physics inside of it

2- creating tools to control my computer using voice commands
i'm a lazy person sometimes and if i can work now so that i can be more lazy latter i'll gladly put the effort

3- a combination of calendar , alarm , diary , notes and todo list programs
right now I'm using ones that are already made by other people but the way they work dose not suite
my needs exactly so i'll be trying to make some of these or maybe all of them

4- a rogue light video game
i like video games they are fun , they can be more fun with friends .                        </p>
